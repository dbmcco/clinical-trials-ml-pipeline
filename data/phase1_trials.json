This likely refers to the placebo used in clinical trials of certepetide (which is Lisata's investigational drug). Placebo matching would mean a placebo that is designed to look identical to the active drug (certepetide) so that trial participants and investigators cannot distinguish between the active treatment and placebo.\n\nNow, let me go through the search results to find any information about FDA warning letters or clinical holds related to certepetide or its placebo.\n\nResult 1: This discusses positive preclinical data for certepetide as part of antibody-drug conjugate combinations.

There's no mention of FDA warning letters or clinical holds.\n\nResult 2: This discusses encouraging preliminary results from the pancreatic cancer cohort of the CENDIFOX trial. It mentions that certepetide demonstrated \"favorable safety, tolerability, and clinical activity in completed and ongoing clinical trials.\" It also states that \"the combination of certepetide with FOLFIRINOX was safe and feasible in patients with resectable and borderline resectable PDAC, with no serious adverse events attributed to certepetide.\" No FDA warning letters or clinical holds are mentioned.\n\nResult 3: This reports that certepetide has been granted FDA orphan drug designation for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma.

In the second stage of the study, participants with moderate to severe OCD (n=56) will be recruited in a multi-center study and treated with BMT plus real or sham MRgFUS for 12 months. Thereafter, those who received sham MRgFUS and did not improve will receive real MRgFUS and then treated with BMT for another 12 months.", "detailed_description": "The proposed study aims to establish the safety and efficacy of ExAblate MR-guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) for patients with treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Bilateral anterior thermo-capsulotomy and gamma-knife capsulotomy are well-known and effective treatments for treatment-refractory OCD patients. In this study, the investigators will use the ExAblate MRgFUS technology (Insightec Ltd) as a new method for capsulotomy for OCD patients. The ExAblate MRgFUS technology for neuro-related clinical applications has received FDA approval for Essential Tremor. In addition, the FDA approved an expansion of the ExAblate Neuro to include the treatment of tremor-dominant Parkinson's Disease. The study is designed to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and intended as a primary clinical support for a future marketing application.\n\nThe investigators propose a two-stage research protocol to establish the safety and efficacy of ExAblate MRgFUS for patients with treatment-resistant OCD. The first stage will be designed as a 'patient as own control' paradigm. Severe, treatment resistant OCD patients (n=10) will be recruited in two centers (Harvard and Stanford) and treated for 6 months by a best medical treatment (BMT) protocol followed by the ExAblate MRgFUS procedure plus BMT for another 12 months. The second stage will be designed as a 'double blind randomized control trial' paradigm. Moderate to severe, partially treatment resistant OCD patients (n=56) will be recruited in a multi-centered study and randomized into the ExAblate MRgFUS or sham procedures. They will be treated by BMT plus MRgFUS or BMT plus sham for 12 months followed by BMT plus the Exablate MRgFUS for the non-responding sham group for another 12 months.\n\nThis study is the first to evaluate ExAblate MRgFUS for OCD in the USA. This protocol was developed by two collaborating centers at Harvard and Stanford Universities, with two experienced and dedicated multidisciplinary teams of psychiatrists, neurosurgeons, psychologists, radiologists and neurologists. The suggested technical protocol using the ExAblate MRgFUS system for OCD is derived from a reported Korean study and an on-going Canadian clinical study.\n\nThe study is funded by the Focused Ultrasound Foundation and Insightec Ltd.", "adverse_events": {"found": false}, "dose_info": {"found": true, "arms": [{"label": "Real FUS", "type": "ACTIVE_COMPARATOR", "description": "The treatment volume and plan will be defined by the neurosurgeon.

cancers.\n* Whereas pulmonary malignancies express a variety of CT-X antigens, immune responses to these proteins are uncommon in lung cancer patients due to low-level, heterogeneous antigen expression, epigenetic repression of genes regulating antigen processing/presentation, and local as well as systemic immunosuppression in these individuals.\n* Conceivably, vaccination of lung cancer

Let me go through each result carefully.\n\nResult 1: This is about a Phase 3 trial of DCVax-L (an autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine) for glioblastoma. It mentions the trial was funded by Northwest Biotherapeutics and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00045968). It states that \"Addition of DCVax-L to standard therapy is feasible and safe in glioblastoma patients, and may extend survival.\" This is not related to the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center's vaccine.\n\nResult 2: This discusses various FDA safety warnings for cancer drugs including pexidartinib, capecitabine, duvelisib, denosumab-bnht, and ciltacabtagene autoleucel. None of these are specifically about a dendritic cell vaccine from Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nResult 3: This describes a UCLA Health clinical trial using a personalized cancer vaccine for H3 G34-mutant diffuse hemispheric glioma. It mentions that the UCLA Health Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center is launching this trial. The vaccine uses dendritic cells. However, there's no mention of FDA warning letters or clinical holds for this vaccine.\n\nResult 4: This is a general review of dendritic cell vaccination for cancer immunotherapy. It states that \"the vast majority of these clinical studies confirmed that DC-based vaccines are safe for cancer patients, causing mild-to-moderate side effects including fever, erythema, flu-like symptoms, rash and/or fatigue, in a small proportion of patients.\" No specific FDA warnings or clinical holds for the Jonsson Center's vaccine are mentioned.\n\nResult 5: This is similar to Result 3, describing the UCLA Health clinical trial for a personalized cancer vaccine targeting H3 G34-mutant diffuse hemispheric glioma. Again, no FDA warnings or clinical holds are mentioned.\n\nResult 6: This appears to be an FDA document about denosumab (Xgeva), not about a dendritic cell vaccine from Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nResult 7: Another article about the UCLA Health Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center initiating a clinical trial for a personalized cancer vaccine", "citations": []}, "sec_filings": {"found": false, "search_params": {"company": "Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center"}, "note": "Skipped SEC search (sponsor not public company)"}, "company_disclosures": {"found": true, "search_query": "Company press releases, investor presentations, or public statements by Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center about clinical trial NCT05457959 for Dendritic Cell Tumor Peptide Vaccine.

Public statements by Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center\n4. Safety issues\n5. Adverse events\n6. Trial termination reasons\n7.

It provides general information about the center, its achievements, and some therapies developed there (like Herceptin, Gleevec, etc.). It mentions that JCCC has over 500 active cancer clinical trials. However, it doesn't specifically mention NCT05457959 or provide safety evidence for this particular trial.\n\nResult [2]: This is about Nivolumab, an immunotherapy drug. It mentions NCT05457959 as a Phase 1 trial that was \"Withdrawn\" at Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, testing \"Vidutolimod (CMP-001) in Combination With Nivolumab for the Treatment of Metastatic...\" However, this seems to be a different trial than what we're looking for (the query is about a Dendritic Cell Tumor Peptide Vaccine, not Vidutolimod). Also, it doesn't provide safety evidence or reasons for withdrawal.\n\nResult [3]: This shows that UCLA's Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center is listed as a trial site with status \"Ongoing, but not recruiting.\" However, it doesn't specify which trial this refers to, and there's no mention of NCT05457959 or safety information.\n\nResult [4]: This is about clinical trials at UCLA Health's Interventional Oncology department, but none of the listed trials match NCT05457959. The trials mentioned are about MRgFUS treatment for prostate lesions, bone tumors, and renal masses.\n\nResult [5]: This is about pembrolizumab, an immunotherapy drug co-developed by a UCLA researcher, but it doesn't mention NCT05457959 or provide safety evidence for the dend", "citations": [], "search_params": {"company": "Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center", "nct_id": "NCT05457959", "drug_name": "Dendritic Cell Tumor Peptide Vaccine"}}}}, "llm_analysis": {"classification": "FAILURE_ADMINISTRATIVE", "confidence": "high", "reasoning": "The official reason given for the trial's withdrawal is \"Never opened,\" which indicates that the trial was terminated due to administrative or operational issues, rather than safety or efficacy concerns.

People with Friedreich Ataxia have difficulty walking, lose sensation in their arms and legs, and have slurred speech.

This type of gene therapy treats a genetic condition by providing a healthy copy of the gene.\n\nAt the time this study started, there was no approved treatment for heart problems in people with Friedreich Ataxia.\n\nIn this study, ASP2016 is being tested in humans for the first time. The people taking part are adults with Friedreich Ataxia who have heart problems.\n\nThe main aims of the study are to check the safety of ASP2016 and how people cope with (tolerate) ASP2016. ASP2016 is given as a slow injection into a vein. This is called an infusion. People will also take tablets of a medicine called prednisolone. This is taken to stop the immune system interfering with ASP2016.\n\nEach person in the study will be given 1 single infusion of ASP2016. Different small groups will receive lower or higher doses of ASP2016. Each person will stay overnight in the clinic for at least 1 night after their infusion.\n\nFor the first few months, people will visit the clinic regularly. There may be the option of home visits by a study nurse at some visits. At the 6-month and 12-month visits extra tests, procedures, and scans will be done. One of these is an ECHO (echocardiogram) scan. This is like an ultrasound scan for the heart. Another is an endomyocardial biopsy. A tiny piece of their heart tissue is removed (biopsy). A flexible hollow tube (catheter) goes into the blood vessels up to the heart. Then, a small device on the end of the catheter takes a tiny piece of heart tissue (about the size of a pencil tip). Another is a cardiac MRI. This takes pictures of the inside of the heart using a powerful magnet. Another is a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). This involves moving a specially designed set of bicycle pedals using hands and arms. This will check how the lungs, heart and muscles are affected during exercise.\n\nAfter the 12-month visit, people will visit the clinic every few months for up to a few years.", "detailed_description": null, "adverse_events": {"found": false}, "dose_info": {"found": true, "arms": [{"label": "ASP2016", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Participants will receive a single dose of ASP2016.

nervous system and muscles. People with Friedreich Ataxia have difficulty walking, lose sensation in their arms and legs, and have slurred speech. It can also affect the heart and many people with Friedrich Ataxia develop serious heart problems. Friedreich Ataxia is a genetic condition which means a faulty gene is passed down through families. This type of gene therapy treats a genetic condition by providing a healthy copy of the gene.\n\nAt the time this study started, there was no approved treatment for heart problems in people with Friedreich Ataxia.\n\nIn this study, ASP2016 is being tested in humans for the first time. The people taking part are adults with Friedreich Ataxia who have heart problems.\n\nThe main aims of the study are to check the safety of ASP2016 and how people cope with (tolerate) ASP2016. ASP2016 is given as a slow injection into a vein. This is called an infusion. People will also take tablets of a medicine called prednisolone. This is taken to stop the immune system interfering with ASP2016.\n\nEach person in the study will be given 1 single infusion of ASP2016. Different small groups will receive lower or higher doses of ASP2016. Each person will stay overnight in the clinic for at least 1 night after their infusion.\n\nFor the first few months, people will visit the clinic regularly. There may be the option of home visits by a study nurse at some visits. At the 6-month and 12-month visits extra tests, procedures, and scans will be done. One of these is an ECHO (echocardiogram) scan. This is like an ultrasound scan for the heart. Another is an endomyocardial biopsy. A tiny piece of their heart tissue is removed (biopsy). A flexible hollow tube (catheter) goes into the blood vessels up to the heart. Then, a small device on the end of the catheter takes a tiny piece of heart tissue (about the size of a pencil tip). Another is a cardiac MRI. This takes pictures of the inside of the heart using a powerful magnet. Another is a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). This involves moving a specially designed set of bicycle pedals using hands and arms. This will check how the lungs, heart and muscles are affected during exercise.\n\nAfter the 12-month visit, people will visit the clinic every few months for up to a few years.", "detailed_description": null, "adverse_events": {"found": false}, "dose_info": {"found": true, "arms": [{"label": "ASP2016", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Participants will receive a single dose of ASP2016.

These cells were grown and frozen and the investigators will select the donor which the investigators think is the best match for the patient. This is a dose escalation study. This means that at the beginning, patients will be started on the lowest dose (1 of 3 different levels) of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells. Once the lower dose schedule proves safe, the next group of patients will be started at a higher dose. This process will continue until all 3 dose levels are studied. If the side effects are too severe, the dose will be lowered or the T cell infusion will be stopped. Both the risks and benefits of this study may be dose related. The investigators don't know the best dose that will provide benefit while minimizing the risks.\n\nTo enroll on this study, patients will need to have recovered from toxic effects of previous chemotherapy and not be receiving any other investigational agents. Patients cannot have received any tumor vaccines within the previous six weeks.\n\nIf patients agree to take part in this study, the investigators will ask the patients to adhere to the following study visits and procedure. After patients have signed the consent form, patients are required to come to the hospital for a series of standard medical screening tests, lymphodepletion chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, infusion with CD30.CAR-EBVST cell treatment and follow-up visits (See details below).\n\n1. Screening tests\n\n   Screening tests include:\n   * Blood tests \\[Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) testing\\] to help us identify the best match for the patient from the banked CD30.CAR-EBVST cells.\n   * Blood tests for viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus \\[HIV\\], human T cell lymphotropic virus \\[HTLV\\], hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus.\n   * Tumor biopsy test to check the status of CD30.\n\n   Once the investigators find that patients are eligible for this study, patients will be called for additional screening tests before treatment day. The screening tests include:\n   * Physical examination\n   * Vital signs tests to measure temperature, pulse, respiratory rate and blood pressure\n   * Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver functions\n   * Urine test\n   * Pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential\n   * Measurements of tumor by routine imaging studies\n2. Lymphodepletion chemotherapy Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to multiply and grow to accomplish their functions and that this may not happen if there are too many other T cells in the blood stream. Because of that, if patients have NOT had a bone marrow or stem cell transplant recently, patients will receive treatment with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (chemotherapy drugs) before patients receive the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells if patients doctor thinks this is appropriate. This is called \"lymphodepletion\". These drugs will decrease the numbers of patients own T cells before the investigators inject the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells. Although the investigators do not expect any effect on the patients tumor with the dose that the patients will receive, these drugs are part of many regimens that are used to treat lymphoma.\n3. Treatment with CD30.CAR-EBVST cells Patients will be given one injection of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells. The CD30.CAR-EBVST cells will be injected into the vein through an IV line at the assigned dose. Before patients receive the injection, patients may be given a dose of acetaminophen or anti-histamine (Benadryl for example) to minimize any possible allergic reaction. The injection of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells will take within 10 minutes. The investigators will follow patients in the clinic after each injection for up to 3 hours. The patient will need to stay less than 2 hours away from the Medical Center for 4 weeks after the CD30.CAR-EBVST cell infusion so the investigator can monitor them for side effects.\n\n   At the discretion of the study doctor, if patients have stable disease (the lymphoma did not grow) or there is a reduction in the size of the patients lymphoma on imaging studies at week 6 after T-cell infusion or on subsequent evaluations, then patients may receive up to two additional doses of the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells at approximately 6 weeks intervals if patients wish to. Lymphodepletion chemotherapy may also be administered before additional doses of CD30.CAR-EBVST infusion. After each T-cell infusion, patients will be monitored to ensure that participants don't have a reaction to the infusion.\n4. Follow-up visits\n\nOn follow-up visits after treatment, patients will also receive a series of standard medical tests:\n\n* Physical examination\n* Vital sign tests to measure temperature, pulse, respiratory rate and blood pressure\n* Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver functions\n* Urine tests (if clinically necessary)\n* Pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential (if clinically necessary)\n* Measurements of tumor by routine imaging studies\n\nAfter infusion of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells,the patients blood will be collected on follow-up visits at week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4, week 8, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 more years. Blood samples and tumor biopsies will also be periodically collected, based on the patients doctor's discretion for exploratory tests in the laboratory. After 5 years, in the event there is suspected or new cancer is detected, additional blood sample will also be collected for additional tests.\n\nTo learn more about the way the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells are working and how long they last in the body, the investigators will draw blood. The total amount of blood collected on any day is about 4-18 teaspoons (18-87 ml). This volume is considered safe but may be decreased if the patients are anemic. Patients blood will be drawn from a central line if participants have one.

Because there is no standard treatment for the patients cancer at this time or because the currently used treatments do not work fully in all cases, the patients are being asked to volunteer in this research study.\n\nIn this study the investigators want to test a type of T cell made from a normal donor. The T cells the investigators will use are called Epstein Barr virus (EBV) specific T cells (EBVSTs) and are cells that the investigators have trained in the laboratory to recognize a EBV which is the virus that causes mono or kissing disease. Some patients with lymphoma have EBV in their cancer cells. Researchers have given T cell lines from normal donor EBVSTs to lymphoma patients who have EBV in their lymphoma cells and have seen responses in about half the patients. The cells have have been generated and are frozen in a bank. The cells are called \"allogeneic\" (meaning the donor is not related to the patient). CD30.CAR in EBV-specific T cells (called allogeneic CD30.CAR-EBVST) from the blood of healthy donors. The investigators are giving the cells to patients with lymphoma cells that express CD30. If the lymphoma cells also express EBV there may be some benefit from targeting both proteins.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to find out the highest safe dose of allogeneic CD30.CAR-EBVST cells given following chemotherapy and used to treat lymphoma. The investigators will learn the side effects of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells in patients and see whether this therapy may help lymphoma patients.", "detailed_description": "Earlier, healthy donors gave blood for us to make CD30.CAR-EBVST cells in the laboratory. These cells were grown and frozen and the investigators will select the donor which the investigators think is the best match for the patient. This is a dose escalation study. This means that at the beginning, patients will be started on the lowest dose (1 of 3 different levels) of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells. Once the lower dose schedule proves safe, the next group of patients will be started at a higher dose. This process will continue until all 3 dose levels are studied. If the side effects are too severe, the dose will be lowered or the T cell infusion will be stopped. Both the risks and benefits of this study may be dose related. The investigators don't know the best dose that will provide benefit while minimizing the risks.\n\nTo enroll on this study, patients will need to have recovered from toxic effects of previous chemotherapy and not be receiving any other investigational agents. Patients cannot have received any tumor vaccines within the previous six weeks.\n\nIf patients agree to take part in this study, the investigators will ask the patients to adhere to the following study visits and procedure. After patients have signed the consent form, patients are required to come to the hospital for a series of standard medical screening tests, lymphodepletion chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, infusion with CD30.CAR-EBVST cell treatment and follow-up visits (See details below).\n\n1. Screening tests\n\n   Screening tests include:\n   * Blood tests \\[Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) testing\\] to help us identify the best match for the patient from the banked CD30.CAR-EBVST cells.\n   * Blood tests for viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus \\[HIV\\], human T cell lymphotropic virus \\[HTLV\\], hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus.\n   * Tumor biopsy test to check the status of CD30.\n\n   Once the investigators find that patients are eligible for this study, patients will be called for additional screening tests before treatment day. The screening tests include:\n   * Physical examination\n   * Vital signs tests to measure temperature, pulse, respiratory rate and blood pressure\n   * Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver functions\n   * Urine test\n   * Pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential\n   * Measurements of tumor by routine imaging studies\n2. Lymphodepletion chemotherapy Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to multiply and grow to accomplish their functions and that this may not happen if there are too many other T cells in the blood stream. Because of that, if patients have NOT had a bone marrow or stem cell transplant recently, patients will receive treatment with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (chemotherapy drugs) before patients receive the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells if patients doctor thinks this is appropriate. This is called \"lymphodepletion\". These drugs will decrease the numbers of patients own T cells before the investigators inject the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells. Although the investigators do not expect any effect on the patients tumor with the dose that the patients will receive, these drugs are part of many regimens that are used to treat lymphoma.\n3. Treatment with CD30.CAR-EBVST cells Patients will be given one injection of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells. The CD30.CAR-EBVST cells will be injected into the vein through an IV line at the assigned dose. Before patients receive the injection, patients may be given a dose of acetaminophen or anti-histamine (Benadryl for example) to minimize any possible allergic reaction. The injection of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells will take within 10 minutes. The investigators will follow patients in the clinic after each injection for up to 3 hours. The patient will need to stay less than 2 hours away from the Medical Center for 4 weeks after the CD30.CAR-EBVST cell infusion so the investigator can monitor them for side effects.\n\n   At the discretion of the study doctor, if patients have stable disease (the lymphoma did not grow) or there is a reduction in the size of the patients lymphoma on imaging studies at week 6 after T-cell infusion or on subsequent evaluations, then patients may receive up to two additional doses of the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells at approximately 6 weeks intervals if patients wish to. Lymphodepletion chemotherapy may also be administered before additional doses of CD30.CAR-EBVST infusion. After each T-cell infusion, patients will be monitored to ensure that participants don't have a reaction to the infusion.\n4. Follow-up visits\n\nOn follow-up visits after treatment, patients will also receive a series of standard medical tests:\n\n* Physical examination\n* Vital sign tests to measure temperature, pulse, respiratory rate and blood pressure\n* Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver functions\n* Urine tests (if clinically necessary)\n* Pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential (if clinically necessary)\n* Measurements of tumor by routine imaging studies\n\nAfter infusion of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells,the patients blood will be collected on follow-up visits at week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4, week 8, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 more years. Blood samples and tumor biopsies will also be periodically collected, based on the patients doctor's discretion for exploratory tests in the laboratory. After 5 years, in the event there is suspected or new cancer is detected, additional blood sample will also be collected for additional tests.\n\nTo learn more about the way the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells are working and how long they last in the body, the investigators will draw blood. The total amount of blood collected on any day is about 4-18 teaspoons (18-87 ml). This volume is considered safe but may be decreased if the patients are anemic. Patients blood will be drawn from a central line if participants have one. The total blood drawn during the patients participation in this study will not exceed 110 teaspoons (546 ml).\n\nThe investigators will also look at any scans or biopsies patients have had as standard of care.", "adverse_events": {"found": false}, "dose_info": {"found": true, "arms": [{"label": "Treatment Phase", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Three dose levels will be evaluated based on safety data from our current study of CD30 CAR T cells.

The current trial's withdrawal suggests potential similar safety challenges, though specific details are not available in the search results.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"INCOMPLETE ",

Search result [12] mentions a clinical trial NCT05950334 for FT522 with Rituximab in relapsed/refractory B-cell conditions, with a note about noncompliance.\n\nKey findings:\n- Rituximab (Rituxan) is manufactured by Genentech, not Fate Therapeutics\n- There is an FDA warning letter to Genentech about Rituxan marketing materials (search result [1])\n- Fate Therapeutics has conducted studies using rituximab in combination with their own products (FT522, AlloNK)\n- There's mention of a Notice of Noncompliance for NCT05950334 (FT522 with Rituximab study) but this relates to clinical trial reporting requirements, not a warning letter or clinical hold\n\nThe user seems to be conflating two things:\n\n\n1. Rituximab is a Genentech product that received FDA warnings\n2. Fate Therapeutics has used rituximab in combination with their therapies\n\nI'll clarify the key points succinctly. Genentech's Rituximab has received FDA warnings about marketing materials, but Fate Therapeutics has no direct warning letters. Their clinical trials using Rituximab have a minor noncompliance note for reporting, which isn't a significant safety concern.\n</think>\n\n```json", "citations": []}, "sec_filings": {"found": true, "search_query": "SEC EDGAR 8-K filings by Fate Therapeutics mentioning clinical trial NCT05934097 or related drug safety issues.

St. Jude Children's Research Hospital - a pediatric cancer research hospital\n\nLooking at the search results, I see several mentions of St. Jude Medical (which is a device company, not related to the hospital), and several mentions of atezolizumab, but I don't see any direct connection between atezolizumab and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in the search results.\n\nLet me go through the search results to identify relevant information:\n\nResults about St. Jude Medical (the device company):\n- [1], [7], [9] discuss FDA warning letters to St. Jude Medical (now Abbott) regarding their cardiac devices (ICDs), not related to atezolizumab\n- These are about medical devices, not drugs\n\nResults about atezolizumab:\n- [2], [4], [5], [8], [15] discuss atezolizumab (Tecentriq)\n- [3] mentions a clinical trial (NCT05286801) studying tiragolumab and atezolizumab for SMARCB1 or SMARCA4 deficient tumors\n- [5] specifically mentions an FDA alert about efficacy and potential safety concerns with atezolizumab in combination with paclitaxel for breast cancer (September 8, 2020)\n- [4] mentions FDA approval of atezolizumab and hyaluronidase-tqjs on September 12, 2024\n- [15] mentions FDA approval of atezolizumab for alveolar soft part sarcoma\n\nI don't see any search results that", "citations": []}, "sec_filings": {"found": false, "search_params": {"company": "St. Jude Children's Research Hospital"}, "note": "Skipped SEC search (sponsor not public company)"}, "company_disclosures": {"found": true, "search_query": "Company press releases, investor presentations, or public statements by St. Jude Children's Research Hospital about clinical trial NCT05468359 for Atezolizumab.

Objectives (Parts 1 \\& 2)\n\n* To determine the number of HCC and FL-HCC xenografts that can be successfully established from children with relapsed or refractory HCC (enrollment on MAST with biopsy for fresh tissue required)\n* To evaluate the immune cell infiltrates in children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors before and after two cycles of cyclophosphamide, sorafenib, bevacizumab and atezolizumab\n* To evaluate the number, type, specificity, repertoire, and activity of intratumoral T cells after two cycles of therapy, compared to baseline\n* To characterize changes in tumor associated macrophages (polarization) between baseline and after two cycles of cyclophosphamide, sorafenib, bevacizumab and atezolizumab\n* To measure changes in tumor mutational burden and mutation heterogeneity\n* To explore associations between T stem cell epigenetic signatures and response to treatment\n* To explore the association between baseline CD45RO+/CD8+ T-cell infiltration and PD-L1 expression and response to treatment\n* To characterize tumor heterogeneity and microenvironment using single-cell/nuclear RNA sequencing pre- and post-treatment\n* To longitudinally assess and quantify numerous metrics of quality of life (QoL), family distress and functional impairment for patients enrolled on ANGIOA and their primary caretakers\n* To qualitatively assess patient and family physical, emotional and psychosocial experiences prior to and after receipt of therapy on ANGIOA through semi-structured interviews\n* To assess the acceptability and feasibility of capturing patient/caregiver interview data at the time of enrollment and discontinuation on ANGIOA\n* To assess the feasibility of performing quantitative multiparametric mapping sequences in patients already undergoing MRI for staging purposes and explore the correlation between quantitative enhancement and other parameters and clinical response\n\nPart 1 (safety/tolerability): Children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors with biopsy accessible and evaluable disease will be treated with two courses of oral PK-guided sorafenib (starting area under the curve (AUC) target: 20-55 ug/ml/hr), oral cyclophosphamide (50 mg/m2/dose, daily (qd) x 21 days), IV bevacizumab (15 mg/kg/dose, every (q) 21 days) and IV atezolizumab (15 mg/kg \\[max dose 1200 mg\\] q 21 days). Tumor biopsies are required before starting treatment and after course two (Section 4.1). Biopsied tissue will be used for enrollment on MAST and to evaluate changes in T-cell infiltration. Sorafenib PK will be obtained and dose adjusted to target an AUC between 20 and 55 hr\u00b7\u00b5g/mL by Day 21 of C1. Tolerability will be defined after completion of Course 1. Part 2 will begin once the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is determined.\n\nPart 2 (efficacy): Children and AYA with relapsed or refractory HCC will be treated with two courses of oral cyclophosphamide and sorafenib with IV bevacizumab and atezolizumab based on the RP2D from Part 1. Tumor response will be assessed after two courses according to immunologic and imaging criteria (Section 4.1). Eligible patients with Fibrolamellar Carcinoma (FL-HCC), desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) or non-central nervous system (CNS) malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT) will be enrolled on separate strata but target accrual will be determined by patients with HCC.", "aact_documents": [], "pubmed_results": [{"pmid": "41234391", "title": "Evaluating the Cardioprotective Effects of Melatonin in

The trial is investigating a combination of four medications:\n- Cyclophosphamide\n- Sorafenib\n- Bevacizumab\n- Atezolizumab\n\nThe trial has two parts:\n1. Part 1: Focuses on safety and tolerability of the combination\n2. Part 2: Focuses on efficacy after two treatment cycles\n\nNow, regarding the status of the trial:\n- Result [1] states: \"Current as of November 14, 2025... Suspended\"\n- Result [4] states: \"Recruitment|Suspended|\"\n\nSo the trial is currently suspended.\n\nNow, I need to find specific information about:\n1. Company press releases, investor presentations, or public statements by St. Jude about this trial\n2. Focus on safety issues, adverse events, trial termination reasons, or regulatory actions\n\nLet me go through each search result to see if they contain this information:\n\nResult [1]: This is from ClinConnect and provides general information about the trial, including that it's suspended. However, it doesn't provide any specific reason for suspension or details about safety issues.\n\nResult [2]: This is St. Jude's news releases page, but it doesn't seem to contain specific information about NCT05468359. It mentions other clinical trials but not this specific one.\n\nResult [3]: This is from ClinicalTrials.gov and provides detailed information about the trial design, objectives, and participation criteria, but doesn't mention why it was suspended or any safety issues.\n\nResult", "citations": [], "search_params": {"company": "St. Jude Children's Research Hospital", "nct_id": "NCT05468359",

It mentions safety population data and adverse events, but this appears to be a different trial than NCT04982354.\n\nResult 3: Mentions NCT04982354 as \"Induction\" with Guenther Koehne from Jazz Pharmaceuticals for Acute Myeloid Leukemia.\n\nResult 4: A press release from Dec 6, 2015 about Novartis drug PKC412 (midostaurin) improving overall survival by 23% in a global Phase III study of AML patients with FLT3 mutations.\n\nResult 5: ClinicalTrials.gov entry for NCT04982354, describing it as a study where \"The FLT3 directed inhibitor, midostaurin, will be given at a dose of 50mg twice daily, starting on day 8 through day 21 of each cycle of CPX-351 until admission...\"\n\nResult 6: Australian Public Assessment Report for Midostaurin (Rydapt) from Novartis, dated January 2019. It contains safety information but appears to be a regulatory document rather than specific to NCT04982354.\n\nResult 7: Clin.larvol.com", "citations": [], "search_params": {"company": "Guenther

These cells are grown and frozen for the patient. To make these special T cells, they are first stimulated with proteins specific for the target 5 viruses, then grow them with stimulator cells. These stimulator cells are irradiated (exposed to X ray waves in the laboratory) so that they can no longer grow. The proteins help the T cells learn to see and attack cells infected with CMV, EBV, Adv, BKV and HHV-6 (the target 5 viruses).\n\nTo get the CD19 antibody to attach to the surface of the T cell, the antibody gene is inserted into the T cell. This is done with a virus called a retrovirus that has been made for this study and will carry the antibody gene into the T cell. This virus also helps us find the T cells in the blood after injection. Once a sufficient number of T cells are made, they are frozen and tested to make sure they kill CD19+ tumor cells and cells infected with CMV, EBV, Adv, BKV and HHV-6 in the laboratory. The investigators will also test the cells to make sure they don't kill other normal cells in the body. Once testing is completed the cells will be ready to give to the patient.\n\nBecause the patient will have received cells with a new gene in them, the patient will be followed for a total of 15 years to see if there are any long term side effects of gene transfer. Because this is what is called a dose-escalation study, the investigators will be testing 3 different doses of T cells to find out which dose is safe, and possibly beneficial. When patients enroll on this study, they will be assigned a dose of CD19 chimeric receptor multivirus specific T cells. The dose received depends on the number of patients who have been treated before the patient, and how well they tolerated the T cells.\n\nPatients will be given an injection of cells into the vein through an IV line at the assigned dose. Before they receive the injection, they may be given a dose of diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and acetaminophen (Tylenol). The injection will take about 10 minutes. The investigators will follow the patient in the clinic after the injection for up to 4 hours. Alternatively, if the patient has a high level of leukemia or lymphoma in the body, the investigators may decide to monitor the patient in the hospital after the injection. Patients will be required to remain local for at least 3 weeks after the T cell injection. This will be discussed before the treatment. The treatment will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital.\n\nMedical tests before treatment- Patients will receive a series of standard medical tests including physical exam and blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function.\n\nMedical tests during and after treatment- Patients will receive standard medical tests when they are getting the infusions and after including physical exams and blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function.\n\nTo learn more about the way the CD19 chimeric receptor multivirus specific T cells are working and how long they last in the body, extra blood will be drawn. This blood may be drawn from a central line (existing long-term IV) if the patient has one. On the day patients receive the cells, blood will be taken before the cells are given and 3 hours afterwards. Other blood will be drawn one week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 8 weeks after the infusion, then at Months 3, 6, 9 and 12. Because patients have had a bone marrow transplant, the majority of these time points would require a blood draw to check the standard medical tests anyway. However, some of these time points may involve an extra trip to clinic and blood draw. Then blood will be drawn every 6 months for 4 years, then yearly for a total of 15 years (up to 30 blood collections). If patients receive the cells at a time when sensitive tests indicate relapse or a high risk of relapse, patients will have additional reviews and blood tests to monitor these tests and look for relapse.\n\nPatients will receive supportive care for acute (short) or chronic (long-term) toxicity, including blood components or antibiotics, and other intervention as appropriate.", "aact_documents": [], "pubmed_results": [{"pmid": "18066957", "title": "Women's views of their experiences in the CHIPS (Control of Hypertension in Pregnancy Study) Pilot Trial.", "authors": [{"name": "Magee LA", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "von Dadelszen P", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Chan S", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}]}], "clinicaltrials_api": {"has_results": false, "brief_summary": "This study is for patients that are having a bone marrow or stem cell transplant for either a type of cancer of the blood called Leukemia or a cancer of the lymph nodes called Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). Although a transplant can cure leukemia or lymphoma, some people will relapse (return of the disease). In those who relapse, current treatment cures only a very small percentage. This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety of a new type of therapy that may help to decrease the risk of relapse or treat relapse after it has occurred.\n\nThe body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. This study combines two of those ways, antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from bacterial and other diseases. T cells are infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells. Antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers; they have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.\n\nThe antibody used in this study is called anti-CD19. This antibody is attracted to cancer cells because of a substance on the outside of these cells called CD19. For this study, the anti-CD19 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor (also known as a CAR T cell). Although anti-CD19 antibodies or chimeric receptors can kill cancer cells, unfortunately they sometimes do not last long enough to destroy all of the cancer cells.\n\nThese CD19 chimeric receptor multivirus specific T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to find the biggest dose of chimeric T cells that is safe to administer, to determine what the side effects are, to see how long the T cells last and to evaluate whether this therapy might help prevent infections and relapse in people with CD19+ leukemia or lymphoma having a bone marrow transplant.", "detailed_description": "First, a donor gave us blood to make CD19 chimeric receptor multivirus specific T cells in the laboratory. These cells are grown and frozen for the patient. To make these special T cells, they are first stimulated with proteins specific for the target 5 viruses, then grow them with stimulator cells. These stimulator cells are irradiated (exposed to X ray waves in the laboratory) so that they can no longer grow. The proteins help the T cells learn to see and attack cells infected with CMV, EBV, Adv, BKV and HHV-6 (the target 5 viruses).\n\nTo get the CD19 antibody to attach to the surface of the T cell, the antibody gene is inserted into the T cell. This is done with a virus called a retrovirus that has been made for this study and will carry the antibody gene into the T cell. This virus also helps us find the T cells in the blood after injection. Once a sufficient number of T cells are made, they are frozen and tested to make sure they kill CD19+ tumor cells and cells infected with CMV, EBV, Adv, BKV and HHV-6 in the laboratory. The investigators will also test the cells to make sure they don't kill other normal cells in the body. Once testing is completed the cells will be ready to give to the patient.\n\nBecause the patient will have received cells with a new gene in them, the patient will be followed for a total of 15 years to see if there are any long term side effects of gene transfer. Because this is what is called a dose-escalation study, the investigators will be testing 3 different doses of T cells to find out which dose is safe, and possibly beneficial. When patients enroll on this study, they will be assigned a dose of CD19 chimeric receptor multivirus specific T cells. The dose received depends on the number of patients who have been treated before the patient, and how well they tolerated the T cells.\n\nPatients will be given an injection of cells into the vein through an IV line at the assigned dose. Before they receive the injection, they may be given a dose of diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and acetaminophen (Tylenol). The injection will take about 10 minutes. The investigators will follow the patient in the clinic after the injection for up to 4 hours. Alternatively, if the patient has a high level of leukemia or lymphoma in the body, the investigators may decide to monitor the patient in the hospital after the injection. Patients will be required to remain local for at least 3 weeks after the T cell injection. This will be discussed before the treatment. The treatment will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital.\n\nMedical tests before treatment- Patients will receive a series of standard medical tests including physical exam and blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function.\n\nMedical tests during and after treatment- Patients will receive standard medical tests when they are getting the infusions and after including physical exams and blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function.\n\nTo learn more about the way the CD19 chimeric receptor multivirus specific T cells are working and how long they last in the body, extra blood will be drawn. This blood may be drawn from a central line (existing long-term IV) if the patient has one. On the day patients receive the cells, blood will be taken before the cells are given and 3 hours afterwards. Other blood will be drawn one week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 8 weeks after the infusion, then at Months 3, 6, 9 and 12. Because patients have had a bone marrow transplant, the majority of these time points would require a blood draw to check the standard medical tests anyway. However, some of these time points may involve an extra trip to clinic and blood draw. Then blood will be drawn every 6 months for 4 years, then yearly for a total of 15 years (up to 30 blood collections).

Conduct exploratory studies measuring levels of circulating myeloid cells including myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in patients treated on this trial and compare levels to those observed in NCI 14-C-0059.\n\nIII. Explore GD2 expression in patients with neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma, including patients who have previously received anti-GD2 antibodies, from tissue and/or bone marrow samples at study entry and if available, after cell infusion.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of GD2CART followed by a dose-expansion study.\n\nLYMPHODEPLETION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) daily on days -5 to -2 and cyclophosphamide IV daily on days -4 to -2.\n\nGD2CART: Patients receive GD2CART cells IV on day 0.\n\nPatients also undergo echocardiogram (ECHO), multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan during screening, blood sample collection throughout the trial, and tumor biopsies and bone marrow aspiration and biopsy as clinically indicated. In addition, patients undergo standard imaging scans throughout the trial.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up three times weekly until day 14, twice weekly until day 28, at months 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12, every 3 months until the end of the second year, then annually for up to 10 years.", "adverse_events": {"found": false}, "dose_info": {"found": true, "arms": [{"label": "Treatment (GD2 CAR T)", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "LYMPHODEPLETION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV daily on days -5 to -2 and cyclophosphamide IV daily on days -4 to -2.\n\nGD2CART: Patients receive GD2CART cells IV on day 0.\n\nPatients also undergo ECHO, MUGA or cardiac MRI scan during screening, blood sample collection throughout the trial, and tumor biopsies and bone marrow aspiration and biopsy as clinically indicated.

After the CAR gene are put into the T cells, the investigators will make sure that they are able to kill hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma cells in the laboratory.\n\nLYMPHODEPLETION CHEMOTHERAPY:\n\nSeveral studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to proliferate and accomplish their functions and that this may not happen if there are too many other T cells in circulation. Because of that, participants will receive treatment with cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and fludarabine for 3 days before receiving the T-cell infusion.

The dose each patient gets will depend on how many participants get the agent before that patient and how they react. The investigator will tell each patient this information.

The investigator will also use this blood to see if there are any long-term side effects of putting the new gene (chimeric antigen receptor, CAR) into the cells. In addition to the blood draws, because patient's have received cells that have had a new gene put in them, they will need to have long term follow up for 15 years so the investigator can see if there are any long term side effects of the gene transfer.\n\nOnce a year, the patient will be asked to have their blood drawn and answer questions about their general health and medical condition.

In the event of death, the investigators will request permission to perform an autopsy to learn more about the effects of the treatment on the patient's disease and if there were any side effects from the cells with the new gene .\n\nIn addition, the investigators will obtain tumor biopsy for research purposes only. Associated risk with the biopsy will be discussed with the participant in detail in a procedure specific consent form. The investigators will test the sample to see if the GPC3-CAR T cells can be found in the tumor and what effect they had on the tumor cells.\n\nIf the patient develops a second abnormal cancer growth, significant blood or nervous system disorder during the trial, a biopsy sample of the tissue will be tested (if a sample can be obtained).", "aact_documents": [], "pubmed_results": [{"pmid": "41234391", "title": "Evaluating the Cardioprotective Effects of Melatonin in Non-metastatic Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Doxorubicin Plus Cyclophosphamide: A Triple-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Randomized Controlled Trial.", "authors": [{"name": "Mousavinia SM", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Larti F", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Ranjbar H", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}]}, {"pmid": "41196599", "title": "Histopathological Response After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for High-Risk Soft-Tissue Sarcomas: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.", "authors": [{"name": "Pasquali S", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Collini P", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Romagosa C", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}]}, {"pmid": "41193417", "title": "Olaparib, durvalumab, and cyclophosphamide, and a prognostic blood signature in platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer: the randomized phase 2 SOLACE2 trial.", "authors": [{"name": "Lee CK", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Kartikasari AER", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Bound NT", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}]}, {"pmid": "41168851", "title": "Lupus enteritis and peritonitis as a first presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus: a case report.", "authors": [{"name": "Douden BKA", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Hashlamon N", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Al-Zaro M", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}]}, {"pmid": "41164763", "title": "Assessing the efficacy and safety of pentoxifylline in preventing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and mucositis in breast cancer patients.", "authors": [{"name": "Dewidar SA", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Mansour NO", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Hamdy O", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}]}], "clinicaltrials_api": {"has_results": false, "brief_summary": "This study is for patients that have a type of cancer that arises from the liver, either called hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma. The cancer has come back, has not gone away after standard treatment or the patient cannot receive standard treatment. This research study will use special immune system cells called TEGAR T cells, a new experimental treatment.\n\nThe body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They have shown promise but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. The investigator found from preclinical research that they can put a new gene into T cells that will help them recognize cancer cells and kill them. In our preclinical studies, several genes were made called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), from an antibody called GC33 that recognizes glypican-3, a protein found on almost all hepatocellular carcinoma cells and hepatoblastoma cells (GPC3-CAR). In the laboratory the investigators have been doing research into GPC3-CAR cells. They have selected the GPC3-CAR with the strongest ability to recognize hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma cells for this study. This is a safety study where the investigator will be testing the ability of GPC3-CAR cells to identify and kill tumor cells in patients. The investigators also tested the effects of adding the molecule interleukin-15 (IL-15) alone or with another molecule called interleukin-21. The investigators found that IL-15 alone or together with IL-21 can help GPC3-CAR T cells last longer which helps them to kill more tumor cells. In this study the investigator will be testing the ability of GPC3-CAR cells to identify and kill tumor cells in patients. This is a study looking at safety and the investigators will therefore be starting with GPC3-CAR T cells alone in a set of patients. The first set of patients will receive GPC3-CAR T cells that also express IL-15. In the second group, the investigators will evaluate GPC3-CAR T cells that express both IL-15 and IL-21. If the investigators are able to safely give GPC3- CAR T cells, they will increase the dose of the combination cells in other patients. The product or dose level of cells that the participant will receive is based on when they are enrolled on the study.\n\nThe GPC3-CAR T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to find the biggest dose of GPC3-CAR T cells that is safe, to see how long they last in the body, to learn what the side effects are and to see if the GPC3-CAR T cells will help people with GPC3-positive hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma.", "detailed_description": "A maximum of 42 subjects will participate in the treatment part of this study.\n\nThe investigators will collect up to 180 mL of the participants blood.

It does mention STS (possibly Sodium Thiosulfate) but not Cytoxan.\n\nResult [2]: This is about various terminated clinical trials, including some oncology cell therapy trials, but doesn't mention NCT04093648 or Baylor College of Medicine specifically.\n\nResult [3]: This is a PDF about the therapeutic potential of interleukin-21 in cancer. It mentions some clinical trials but not NCT04093648.\n\nResult [4]: This is about an FDA partial clinical hold on Xencor's Phase I trial of XmAb14045 due to patient deaths, but not related to NCT04093648 or Baylor.\n\nResult [5]: This is directly about NCT04093648! It states: \"This is a safety study where the investigator will be testing the ability of GPC3-CAR cells to identify and kill tumor cells in patients.\" This trial appears to be related to GPC3-CAR cells, not Cytoxan specifically. GPC3 stands for Glypican-3, which is a target for liver cancer therapy as mentioned in result [7].\n\nResult [6]: This is a protocol document for NCT05032820, which is a Phase II trial of anti-B Cell Maturation Antigen Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell Therapy for Multiple Myeloma.

mL of the participants blood. The investigators will use this blood to grow T cells. They will grow the T cells and use a retrovirus (a special virus that can carry the GPC3 CAR gene into the T cells) to genetically engineer them. After the CAR gene are put into the T cells, the investigators will make sure that they are able to kill hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma cells in the laboratory.\n\nLYMPHODEPLETION CHEMOTHERAPY:\n\nSeveral studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to proliferate and accomplish their functions and that this may not happen if there are too many other T cells in circulation. Because of that, participants will receive treatment with cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and fludarabine for 3 days before receiving the T-cell infusion. These drugs will decrease the numbers of the participants' T cells before the investigator infuse the GPC3-CAR T cells.\n\nWHAT THE INFUSION WILL BE LIKE:\n\nAfter making these cells, they were frozen. If the patient agrees to participate in this study, they will be scheduled to be treated, the cells will then be thawed and injected into the participant over 5 to 10 minutes. The participant will receive the GPC3-CAR T CELLS 48-72 hours after completing the chemotherapy. The participant may be pretreated with Tylenol (acetaminophen) and Benadryl (diphenhydramine). Tylenol and Benadryl are given to prevent a possible allergic reaction to the T cell administration.\n\nThis is a dose escalation study, which means that investigator does not know the highest dose of GPC3-CAR T cells that is safe. To find out, the investigator will give the cells to at least 3 participants at one dose level. If that is safe, the investigator will raise the dose given to the next group of participants. The dose each patient gets will depend on how many participants get the agent before that patient and how they react. The investigator will tell each patient this information. This will help the patient think about possible harms and benefits. Since the treatment is experimental, what is likely to happen at any dose is not known.\n\nAll of the Treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Houston Methodist Hospital.\n\nMedical tests before treatment:\n\n* Physical exam and History\n* EKG (electrocardiogram) to assess heart function\n* Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function and blood clotting (INR).\n* If the patient is infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) they will do a test to measure the levels of the virus\n* Pregnancy test (if the patient is a female who can get pregnant)\n* Measurements of the patient's tumor by scans (CT/MRI) and the tumor marker alfa-fetoprotein (AFP), if the patient's tumor produces this protein.\n\nMedical tests during and after treatment:\n\n* Physical exams and History\n* Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function and blood clotting (INR)\n* If the patient is infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV), the investigator will do a test to measure the levels of the virus\n* Measurements of the tumor maker alfa-fetoprotein (AFP), if the patient's tumor produces this protein\n* Measurements of the patient's tumor by CT/MRI scans (6 -8 weeks after the infusion)\n* Tumor biopsy\n\nFOLLOW-UP STUDIES\n\nThe investigators will follow the participant during and after the injections. To learn more about the way the T cells are working in the patient's body, up to 60 mL (12 teaspoons) of blood will be taken from the participant before the chemotherapy, before the T-cell infusion, 3 to 4 hours after the infusion, 3 to 4 days after the infusion (this time point is optional) at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 8 weeks after the injection, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years and then every year for the next 10 years. Total time participation for this study will be 15 years.\n\nDuring the time points listed above, if the T cells are found in the patient's blood at a certain amount an extra 5 mL of blood may need to be collected for additional testing.\n\nThe investigator will use this blood to look for the frequency and activity of the cells that they have given ; that is, to learn more about the way the T cells are working and how long they last in the body. The investigator will also use this blood to see if there are any long-term side effects of putting the new gene (chimeric antigen receptor, CAR) into the cells. In addition to the blood draws, because patient's have received cells that have had a new gene put in them, they will need to have long term follow up for 15 years so the investigator can see if there are any long term side effects of the gene transfer.\n\nOnce a year, the patient will be asked to have their blood drawn and answer questions about their general health and medical condition. The investigators may ask the patient to report any recent hospitalizations, new medications, or the development of conditions or illness that were not present when the patient enrolled in the study and may request that physical exams and/or laboratory tests be performed if necessary.\n\nIn the event that a tumor biopsy is performed for clinical reasons the investigators will request permission to obtain excess sample to learn more about the effects of the treatment on the patient's disease. In the event of death, the investigators will request permission to perform an autopsy to learn more about the effects of the treatment on the patient's disease and if there were any side effects from the cells with the new gene .\n\nIn addition, the investigators will obtain tumor biopsy for research purposes only. Associated risk with the biopsy will be discussed with the participant in detail in a procedure specific consent form. The investigators will test the sample to see if the GPC3-CAR T cells can be found in the tumor and what effect they had on the tumor cells.\n\nIf the patient develops a second abnormal cancer growth, significant blood or nervous system disorder during the trial, a biopsy sample of the tissue will be tested (if a sample can be obtained).", "aact_documents": [], "pubmed_results": [{"pmid": "41146244", "title": "Comparative preclinical drug response analyses of T-prolymphocytic leukemia reveal no differences between known gene expression subgroups.", "authors": [{"name": "Mikhaylenko N", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Braun T", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Timonen S", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}]}, {"pmid": "41110448", "title": "IL-10-expressing, anti-CD19 CAR T cells for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: an open-label, single-arm, phase 1 study.", "authors": [{"name": "Xu Q", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Guo Y", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Gao M", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}]}, {"pmid": "41037957", "title": "Preliminary safety and efficacy of relmacabtagene autoleucel (relma-cel) in adults with moderately to severely active systemic lupus erythematosus: a phase I dose-escalation study.", "authors": [{"name": "Wang Y", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Yang S", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Yu Y", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}]}, {"pmid": "40960310", "title": "Long-term outcomes of CNCT19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy in relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma.", "authors": [{"name": "Liu W", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Xie T", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Zhang Z", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}]}, {"pmid": "40859744", "title": "Randomization in phase II trials: No exemption based on sample size.", "authors": [{"name": "Framke T", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Beutel G", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Ganser A", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}]}], "clinicaltrials_api": {"has_results": false, "brief_summary": "This study is for patients that have a type of cancer that arises from the liver, either called hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma.

T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They have shown promise but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. The investigator found from preclinical research that they can put a new gene into T cells that will help them recognize cancer cells and kill them. In our preclinical studies, several genes were made called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), from an antibody called GC33 that recognizes glypican-3, a protein found on almost all hepatocellular carcinoma cells and hepatoblastoma cells (GPC3-CAR). In the laboratory the investigators have been doing research into GPC3-CAR cells. They have selected the GPC3-CAR with the strongest ability to recognize hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma cells for this study. This is a safety study where the investigator will be testing the ability of GPC3-CAR cells to identify and kill tumor cells in patients. The investigators also tested the effects of adding the molecule interleukin-15 (IL-15) alone or with another molecule called interleukin-21. The investigators found that IL-15 alone or together with IL-21 can help GPC3-CAR T cells last longer which helps them to kill more tumor cells. In this study the investigator will be testing the ability of GPC3-CAR cells to identify and kill tumor cells in patients. This is a study looking at safety and the investigators will therefore be starting with GPC3-CAR T cells alone in a set of patients. The first set of patients will receive GPC3-CAR T cells that also express IL-15. In the second group, the investigators will evaluate GPC3-CAR T cells that express both IL-15 and IL-21. If the investigators are able to safely give GPC3- CAR T cells, they will increase the dose of the combination cells in other patients. The product or dose level of cells that the participant will receive is based on when they are enrolled on the study.\n\nThe GPC3-CAR T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to find the biggest dose of GPC3-CAR T cells that is safe, to see how long they last in the body, to learn what the side effects are and to see if the GPC3-CAR T cells will help people with GPC3-positive hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma.", "detailed_description": "A maximum of 42 subjects will participate in the treatment part of this study.\n\nThe investigators will collect up to 180 mL of the participants blood. The investigators will use this blood to grow T cells. They will grow the T cells and use a retrovirus (a special virus that can carry the GPC3 CAR gene into the T cells) to genetically engineer them. After the CAR gene are put into the T cells, the investigators will make sure that they are able to kill hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma cells in the laboratory.\n\nLYMPHODEPLETION CHEMOTHERAPY:\n\nSeveral studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to proliferate and accomplish their functions and that this may not happen if there are too many other T cells in circulation. Because of that, participants will receive treatment with cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and fludarabine for 3 days before receiving the T-cell infusion. These drugs will decrease the numbers of the participants' T cells before the investigator infuse the GPC3-CAR T cells.\n\nWHAT THE INFUSION WILL BE LIKE:\n\nAfter making these cells, they were frozen. If the patient agrees to participate in this study, they will be scheduled to be treated, the cells will then be thawed and injected into the participant over 5 to 10 minutes. The participant will receive the GPC3-CAR T CELLS 48-72 hours after completing the chemotherapy. The participant may be pretreated with Tylenol (acetaminophen) and Benadryl (diphenhydramine). Tylenol and Benadryl are given to prevent a possible allergic reaction to the T cell administration.\n\nThis is a dose escalation study, which means that investigator does not know the highest dose of GPC3-CAR T cells that is safe. To find out, the investigator will give the cells to at least 3 participants at one dose level. If that is safe, the investigator will raise the dose given to the next group of participants. The dose each patient gets will depend on how many participants get the agent before that patient and how they react. The investigator will tell each patient this information. This will help the patient think about possible harms and benefits. Since the treatment is experimental, what is likely to happen at any dose is not known.\n\nAll of the Treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Houston Methodist Hospital.\n\nMedical tests before treatment:\n\n* Physical exam and History\n* EKG (electrocardiogram) to assess heart function\n* Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function and blood clotting (INR).\n* If the patient is infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) they will do a test to measure the levels of the virus\n* Pregnancy test (if the patient is a female who can get pregnant)\n* Measurements of the patient's tumor by scans (CT/MRI) and the tumor marker alfa-fetoprotein (AFP), if the patient's tumor produces this protein.\n\nMedical tests during and after treatment:\n\n* Physical exams and History\n* Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function and blood clotting (INR)\n* If the patient is infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV), the investigator will do a test to measure the levels of the virus\n* Measurements of the tumor maker alfa-fetoprotein (AFP), if the patient's tumor produces this protein\n* Measurements of the patient's tumor by CT/MRI scans (6 -8 weeks after the infusion)\n* Tumor biopsy\n\nFOLLOW-UP STUDIES\n\nThe investigators will follow the participant during and after the injections. To learn more about the way the T cells are working in the patient's body, up to 60 mL (12 teaspoons) of blood will be taken from the participant before the chemotherapy, before the T-cell infusion, 3 to 4 hours after the infusion, 3 to 4 days after the infusion (this time point is optional) at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 8 weeks after the injection, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years and then every year for the next 10 years. Total time participation for this study will be 15 years.\n\nDuring the time points listed above, if the T cells are found in the patient's blood at a certain amount an extra 5 mL of blood may need to be collected for additional testing.\n\nThe investigator will use this blood to look for the frequency and activity of the cells that they have given ; that is, to learn more about the way the T cells are working and how long they last in the body. The investigator will also use this blood to see if there are any long-term side effects of putting the new gene (chimeric antigen receptor, CAR) into the cells. In addition to the blood draws, because patient's have received cells that have had a new gene put in them, they will need to have long term follow up for 15 years so the investigator can see if there are any long term side effects of the gene transfer.\n\nOnce a year, the patient will be asked to have their blood drawn and answer questions about their general health and medical condition. The investigators may ask the patient to report any recent hospitalizations, new medications, or the development of conditions or illness that were not present when the patient enrolled in the study and may request that physical exams and/or laboratory tests be performed if necessary.\n\nIn the event that a tumor biopsy is performed for clinical reasons the investigators will request permission to obtain excess sample to learn more about the effects of the treatment on the patient's disease. In the event of death, the investigators will request permission to perform an autopsy to learn more about the effects of the treatment on the patient's disease and if there were any side effects from the cells with the new gene .\n\nIn addition, the investigators will obtain tumor biopsy for research purposes only. Associated risk with the biopsy will be discussed with the participant in detail in a procedure specific consent form. The investigators will test the sample to see if the GPC3-CAR T cells can be found in the tumor and what effect they had on the tumor cells.\n\nIf the patient develops a second abnormal cancer growth, significant blood or nervous system disorder during the trial, a biopsy sample of the tissue will be tested (if a sample can be obtained).", "adverse_events": {"found": false}, "dose_info": {"found": true, "arms": [{"label": "TEGAR T cells + Fludarabine and Cytoxan", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "GPC3-CAR (TEGAR T cells) along with lymphodepleting chemotherapy (Cytoxan and Fludarabine) will be administered to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.", "intervention_names": ["Genetic: TEGAR T cells", "Drug: Cytoxan", "Drug: Fludarabine"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "GENETIC", "name": "TEGAR T cells", "description": "Five different dosing schedules will be evaluated.

Unlike a regular blood draw or \"whole blood\" donation in which whole blood is removed from patient's body, the apheresis process connects the patient to a machine that removes a particular component of their blood and then returns the rest of the blood back to them. The white blood cells collected during leukocyte apheresis will be used to make the GINAKIT cells.\n\nOnce collected, the white blood cells will be mixed with a special protein to separate the Natural Killer T cells from the white blood cells using a special machine called a CliniMACS Reagent System in the laboratory.

After the new gene has been put into the Natural Killer T cells, the cells will be tested to make sure that they kill GD2-positive neuroblastoma cells and that the cells are killed by the activation of iC9. The GINAKIT cells may be given back to the patient fresh or frozen.\n\nThis is a dose escalation study. This means that at the beginning, patients will be started on the lowest dose (1 of 4 different levels) of GINAKIT cells.

This study combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and Natural Killer T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. The investigators have found from previous research that they can put a new gene into T cells that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. In a previous clinical trial, the investigators made a gene called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), from an antibody called 14g2a that recognizes GD2, a molecule found on almost all neuroblastoma cells (GD2-CAR). They put this gene into the patients' own T cells and gave them back to patients that had neuroblastoma. Nineteen patients were treated on that study and there were no long term side-effects seen after the GD2 T cell infusion. As the investigators have followed the patients over time, they noticed that for those patients with disease at the time of their infusion, the time to progression (the amount of time it takes before their neuroblastoma got worse) was longer in those whom they could find GD2 T cells in the blood for more than 6 weeks after the last T cell infusion. Because of this, the investigators think that if effector cells are able to last longer, they may have a better chance of killing neuroblastoma tumor cells.\n\nNatural Killer T cells are a special subset of innate lymphocytes that can effectively go into tumor tissues of neuroblastoma. Inside the tumor, there are certain white blood cells which help the cancer cells to grow and recover from injury. Natural Killer T-cells can specifically kill these cells. In this study, Natural Killer T cells will be genetically engineered to express GD2-CAR to attack neuroblastoma cells and the white blood cells inside the tumor tissue.", "detailed_description": "To prepare the neuroblastoma specific Natural Killer T cells (also called GINAKIT cells), about 80 mL (up to 6 tablespoons) of blood will be collected from the patient.

the neuroblastoma specific Natural Killer T cells (also called GINAKIT cells), about 80 mL (up to 6 tablespoons) of blood will be collected from the patient. For children, the total amount of blood drawn will not be more than 3 ml (less than 1 teaspoon) per 2.2 lbs of body weight.\n\nIn case the neuroblastoma specific Natural Killer T cells cannot be expanded from the amount of blood that can safely be drawn from the patient, the investigators may attempt to collect white blood cells from the patient by using a special type of blood donation called leukocyte apheresis. Unlike a regular blood draw or \"whole blood\" donation in which whole blood is removed from patient's body, the apheresis process connects the patient to a machine that removes a particular component of their blood and then returns the rest of the blood back to them. The white blood cells collected during leukocyte apheresis will be used to make the GINAKIT cells.\n\nOnce collected, the white blood cells will be mixed with a special protein to separate the Natural Killer T cells from the white blood cells using a special machine called a CliniMACS Reagent System in the laboratory. This is an investigational device that is not approved by the FDA. Although this device is not approved for use in this country, it has been in use for years and is approved in other countries. The investigators will put the new genes into patient's Natural Killer T cells by mixing them with a retroviral vector (a special virus that can carry a new gene into cells) containing the new gene called iC9-GD2-CD28-OX40. After the new gene has been put into the Natural Killer T cells, the cells will be tested to make sure that they kill GD2-positive neuroblastoma cells and that the cells are killed by the activation of iC9. The GINAKIT cells may be given back to the patient fresh or frozen.\n\nThis is a dose escalation study. This means that at the beginning, patients will be started on the lowest dose (1 of 4 different levels) of GINAKIT cells. Once that dose schedule proves safe, the next group of patients will be started at a higher dose. This process will continue until all 4 dose levels are studied. If the side effects are too severe, the dose will be lowered or the infusions will be stopped.\n\nBefore getting the GINAKIT cells, patients will receive cyclophosphamide and fludarabine intraveneously for 2 days and then fludarabine alone for one more day. Patients will then have one day of rest with no chemotherapy before receiving the GINAKIT cells.\n\nThe treatment will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital. Patients will need to stay in Houston for 4 weeks after the infusion so the investigators can monitor them for side effects. They will have follow-up visits (at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8; months 3, 6, 9, and 12; twice a year for 4 years and then once a year for the next 10 years - for a total of 15 years) and scheduled disease evaluations after the GINAKIT cell infusion (at week 4 and then as clinically needed). Also, to learn more about the way the GINAKIT cells are working and how long they last in the body, blood will be obtained before the chemotherapy, on the day of the GINAKIT cell infusion (before and at the end of the infusion) and at the follow-up visits (time points listed above).\n\nIf the patient experiences no significant side effects during or after the first GINAKIT cell infusion and their cancer remains stable or responds, they may be offered additional doses of the same cell dose in the future.", "aact_documents": [], "pubmed_results": [{"pmid": "41146244", "title": "Comparative preclinical drug response analyses of T-prolymphocytic leukemia reveal no differences between known gene expression subgroups.", "authors": [{"name": "Mikhaylenko N", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Braun T", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Timonen S", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}]}, {"pmid": "41110448", "title": "IL-10-expressing, anti-CD19 CAR T cells for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: an open-label, single-arm, phase 1 study.", "authors": [{"name": "Xu Q", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Guo Y", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Gao M", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}]}, {"pmid": "41037957", "title": "Preliminary safety and efficacy of relmacabtagene autoleucel (relma-cel) in adults with moderately to severely active systemic lupus erythematosus: a phase I dose-escalation study.", "authors": [{"name": "Wang Y", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Yang S", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Yu Y", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}]}, {"pmid": "40960310", "title": "Long-term outcomes of CNCT19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy in relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma.", "authors": [{"name": "Liu W", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Xie T", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Zhang Z", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}]}, {"pmid": "40859744", "title": "Randomization in phase II trials: No exemption based on sample size.", "authors": [{"name": "Framke T", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Beutel G", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Ganser A", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}]}], "clinicaltrials_api": {"has_results": false, "brief_summary": "This research study is for patients that have a cancer called Neuroblastoma that has either come back after treatment or did not respond to the standard medicines used to treat it. This study combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and Natural Killer T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. The investigators have found from previous research that they can put a new gene into T cells that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. In a previous clinical trial, the investigators made a gene called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), from an antibody called 14g2a that recognizes GD2, a molecule found on almost all neuroblastoma cells (GD2-CAR). They put this gene into the patients' own T cells and gave them back to patients that had neuroblastoma. Nineteen patients were treated on that study and there were no long term side-effects seen after the GD2 T cell infusion. As the investigators have followed the patients over time, they noticed that for those patients with disease at the time of their infusion, the time to progression (the amount of time it takes before their neuroblastoma got worse) was longer in those whom they could find GD2 T cells in the blood for more than 6 weeks after the last T cell infusion. Because of this, the investigators think that if effector cells are able to last longer, they may have a better chance of killing neuroblastoma tumor cells.\n\nNatural Killer T cells are a special subset of innate lymphocytes that can effectively go into tumor tissues of neuroblastoma. Inside the tumor, there are certain white blood cells which help the cancer cells to grow and recover from injury. Natural Killer T-cells can specifically kill these cells. In this study, Natural Killer T cells will be genetically engineered to express GD2-CAR to attack neuroblastoma cells and the white blood cells inside the tumor tissue.", "detailed_description": "To prepare the neuroblastoma specific Natural Killer T cells (also called GINAKIT cells), about 80 mL (up to 6 tablespoons) of blood will be collected from the patient. For children, the total amount of blood drawn will not be more than 3 ml (less than 1 teaspoon) per 2.2 lbs of body weight.\n\nIn case the neuroblastoma specific Natural Killer T cells cannot be expanded from the amount of blood that can safely be drawn from the patient, the investigators may attempt to collect white blood cells from the patient by using a special type of blood donation called leukocyte apheresis. Unlike a regular blood draw or \"whole blood\" donation in which whole blood is removed from patient's body, the apheresis process connects the patient to a machine that removes a particular component of their blood and then returns the rest of the blood back to them. The white blood cells collected during leukocyte apheresis will be used to make the GINAKIT cells.\n\nOnce collected, the white blood cells will be mixed with a special protein to separate the Natural Killer T cells from the white blood cells using a special machine called a CliniMACS Reagent System in the laboratory. This is an investigational device that is not approved by the FDA. Although this device is not approved for use in this country, it has been in use for years and is approved in other countries. The investigators will put the new genes into patient's Natural Killer T cells by mixing them with a retroviral vector (a special virus that can carry a new gene into cells) containing the new gene called iC9-GD2-CD28-OX40. After the new gene has been put into the Natural Killer T cells, the cells will be tested to make sure that they kill GD2-positive neuroblastoma cells and that the cells are killed by the activation of iC9. The GINAKIT cells may be given back to the patient fresh or frozen.\n\nThis is a dose escalation study. This means that at the beginning, patients will be started on the lowest dose (1 of 4 different levels) of GINAKIT cells. Once that dose schedule proves safe, the next group of patients will be started at a higher dose. This process will continue until all 4 dose levels are studied. If the side effects are too severe, the dose will be lowered or the infusions will be stopped.\n\nBefore getting the GINAKIT cells, patients will receive cyclophosphamide and fludarabine intraveneously for 2 days and then fludarabine alone for one more day. Patients will then have one day of rest with no chemotherapy before receiving the GINAKIT cells.\n\nThe treatment will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital. Patients will need to stay in Houston for 4 weeks after the infusion so the investigators can monitor them for side effects. They will have follow-up visits (at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8; months 3, 6, 9, and 12; twice a year for 4 years and then once a year for the next 10 years - for a total of 15 years) and scheduled disease evaluations after the GINAKIT cell infusion (at week 4 and then as clinically needed). Also, to learn more about the way the GINAKIT cells are working and how long they last in the body, blood will be obtained before the chemotherapy, on the day of the GINAKIT cell infusion (before and at the end of the infusion) and at the follow-up visits (time points listed above).\n\nIf the patient experiences no significant side effects during or after the first GINAKIT cell infusion and their cancer remains stable or responds, they may be offered additional doses of the same cell dose in the future.", "adverse_events": {"found": false}, "dose_info": {"found": true, "arms": [{"label": "GINAKIT Cells plus chemotherapy", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Patients receive chemotherapy with Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide and then an infusion of the GINAKIT cells (iC9-GD2.CD28.OX40.zeta Natural Killer T cells)", "intervention_names": ["Drug: cyclophosphamide", "Drug: Fludarabine", "Genetic: GINAKIT Cells"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "cyclophosphamide", "description": "500 mg/m2/day x 2 days; for patients \\<12 kg the dose is 16.7 mg/kg/day x 2 days; Cyclophospamide will be given daily starting Day -4 prior to administration of GINAKIT cells.", "arm_group_labels": ["GINAKIT Cells plus chemotherapy"]}, {"type": "DRUG", "name": "Fludarabine", "description": "30 mg/m2/day x 3 days; for patients \\<12 kg the dose is 1 mg/kg/day x 3 days; Fludarabine will be given daily starting Day -4 prior to administration of GINAKIT cells", "arm_group_labels": ["GINAKIT Cells plus chemotherapy"]}, {"type": "GENETIC", "name": "GINAKIT Cells", "description": "* Dose Level 1 = 3 x 10\\^6\n* Dose Level 2 = 1 x 10\\^7\n* Dose Level 3 = 3 x 10\\^7\n* Dose Level 4 = 1 x 10\\^8\n\nAfter the end of the 4 week evaluation period, if subjects have not had a severe side effects and if disease has not gotten worse, the subjects may be offered additional doses of the same cell dose in the future.", "arm_group_labels": ["GINAKIT Cells plus chemotherapy"]}]}}, "company_search_urls": ["https://www.google.com/search?q=Baylor College of Medicine+NCT02439788+terminated", "https://www.google.com/search?q=Baylor College of Medicine+Fludarabine+clinical+trial+terminated"], "external_signals": {"fda_warnings": {"found": true, "search_query": "FDA warning letters or clinical holds for Fludarabine by Baylor College of Medicine.

T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. The investigators have found from previous research that they can put a new gene into T cells that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. In a previous clinical trial, the investigators made a gene called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), from an antibody called 14g2a that recognizes GD2, a molecule found on almost all neuroblastoma cells (GD2-CAR). They put this gene into the patients' own T cells and gave them back to patients that had neuroblastoma.

A second group (IAK) will include subjects with renal failure secondary to diabetes who have received a prior kidney transplant at least 6 months previously and have stable renal function on a steroid-free immunosuppressive regimen.\n\nPotential study participants will be recruited from the Endocrinology and Transplant clinics at the Ohio State University, and community physician referrals. Those who are potentially eligible will undergo a screening evaluation after review of the medical records. If the subject remains eligible, he/she will be enrolled in the islet transplant study and will be placed on a waiting list for an islet transplant. Once a transplant becomes available, the subject will be admitted to the hospital to undergo the transplant procedure. Frequent follow-up visits in the transplant clinic will occur throughout the following year after the transplant. Subjects will be closely monitored for adverse events and insulin requirements. If the subject does not achieve insulin independence, he/she may be eligible for a subsequent transplant.\n\nThere will be a 10-year enrollment with 12-month follow-up after last transplant. Since subjects may be eligible for a subsequent transplant within 18 months of the first transplant, the total duration may be up to 30 months after the first transplant in some subjects.\n\nThe study will be completed one year after the last islet transplant.

Subjects will be eligible for an islet transplant if they meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria outlined in the protocol. In brief, the aims of this study are to establish an islet transplant program at the Ohio State University, determine the safety of islet transplantation in islet alone and kidney transplant recipients, determine whether islet transplantation will reduce the frequency of severe hypoglycemic events, determine whether a novel steroid-free immunosuppressive protocol will prevent rejection in islet transplants and to achieve insulin independence at one year after the final islet transplant.", "detailed_description": "Hypothesis - Insulin independence (insulin injections no longer needed) will be achieved in subjects with type 1 diabetes receiving islet transplantation using the immunosuppressive regimen of cyclosporine and sirolimus. Amelioration of severe hypoglycemia will also be achieved in these groups.\n\nPrimary Objective\n\nTo determine the safety of islet transplantation in islet alone and in kidney transplant recipients. Safety analyses include:\n\n* Incidence, timing and severity of adverse events and their relationship to the transplant protocol, islet infusion and immunosuppressive medications\n* Proportion without protocol-related serious adverse events (SAE) at 1 year\n* Incidence, type and severity of infectious complications\n* Incidence and severity of procedural-related events, such as bleeding and portal vein thrombosis\n* Incidence and severity of liver function test elevations\n* Incidence and severity of hypoglycemia\n* Incidence and severity of creatinine clearance and urine microalbumin changes\n* Incidence and severity of lipid abnormalities\n* Proportion of those who develop donor-specific alloantibody\n\nSecondary Objective\n\nTo determine the efficacy of islet transplantation in islet alone and in kidney transplant recipients. Efficacy analyses include:\n\n* Time to insulin independence, defined as freedom from insulin use (insulin injections not needed) for 14 or more consecutive days\n* Proportion of those that achieve insulin independence at any time during the first year\n* Proportion of those one year after final transplant who have:\n\n  * Positive C-peptide (\u22650.3 ng/ml after stimulation)\n  * Full function of their graft\n  * Partial function of their graft\n  * Marginal function of their graft\n  * Mixed meal stimulated C-peptide \\>1.0 ng/ml at 6, and 12 months\n* Proportion of those that have an acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg) \\>20uU/ml during frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) at 6 and 12 months\n* Proportion of those with blood glucose level \\<140 mg/dl two hours after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 6 and 12 months\n* Proportion of those that have improved QOL at 6 and 12 months compared with baseline\n* Proportion of those that have improved hypoglycemia and glycemic lability scores at 6 and 12 months compared with baseline\n\nDefinition of full islet function:\n\n* Insulin independence\n* A1C \u2264 6.5%\n* Absence of severe hypoglycemic episodes\n* Fasting glucose \u2265140 mg/dl less than 3 times a week\n* Post-prandial glucose (2 hours) \\>180 mg/dl less than 4 times a week\n\nDefinition of partial islet function:\n\n* Insulin requirement less than 50% of pre-transplant insulin requirement\n* C-peptide positive (\u22650.3 ng/ml after stimulation)\n* A1C \u2264 6.5%\n* No severe hypoglycemia\n\nDefinition of marginal islet function:\n\n* C-peptide positive (\u22650.3 ng/ml after stimulation)\n* A1C \u2264 7.5%\n* No severe hypoglycemia\n\nThis trial will have two study groups consisting of N=10 subjects with type 1 diabetes. One group (IA) will include subjects with preserved kidney function. A second group (IAK) will include subjects with renal failure secondary to diabetes who have received a prior kidney transplant at least 6 months previously and have stable renal function on a steroid-free immunosuppressive regimen.\n\nPotential study participants will be recruited from the Endocrinology and Transplant clinics at the Ohio State University, and community physician referrals. Those who are potentially eligible will undergo a screening evaluation after review of the medical records. If the subject remains eligible, he/she will be enrolled in the islet transplant study and will be placed on a waiting list for an islet transplant. Once a transplant becomes available, the subject will be admitted to the hospital to undergo the transplant procedure. Frequent follow-up visits in the transplant clinic will occur throughout the following year after the transplant. Subjects will be closely monitored for adverse events and insulin requirements. If the subject does not achieve insulin independence, he/she may be eligible for a subsequent transplant.\n\nThere will be a 10-year enrollment with 12-month follow-up after last transplant. Since subjects may be eligible for a subsequent transplant within 18 months of the first transplant, the total duration may be up to 30 months after the first transplant in some subjects.\n\nThe study will be completed one year after the last islet transplant. Subjects who have undergone the islet transplant procedure and have completed the post-transplant evaluations one year after their last transplant will be considered to have completed the study.", "adverse_events": {"found": false}, "dose_info": {"found": true, "arms": [{"label": "Subjects with preserved kidney function", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Subjects with preserved renal function that have not previously received a kidney transplant will be treated with Human Pancreatic Islets (in the form of islets alone - IA).", "intervention_names": ["Drug: Human Pancreatic Islets"]}, {"label": "Subjects with prior kidney transplant", "type": "EXPERIMENTAL", "description": "Subjects with renal failure secondary to diabetes who have received a prior kidney transplant at least 6 months previously and have stable renal function on a steroid-free immunosuppressive regimen will receive Human Pancreatic Islets (in the form of islets after kidney - IAK).", "intervention_names": ["Drug: Human Pancreatic Islets"]}], "interventions": [{"type": "DRUG", "name": "Human Pancreatic Islets", "description": "Pancreatic islet tissue suspended in 150 - 300 ml of phenol red-free CMRL-1066 Transplant Media supplemented with 4% (w/v) HSA and 16mM HEPES in a 600ml transfer pack.
