The chemotherapy will kill cancer cells, but good cells, such as those in the mouth, are killed too. The mouth cells going away causes the areas in the mouth to be blistered, irritated, sore, and extremely painful. Pain medication (usually morphine or hydromorphone if allergic to morphine) are given when oral blisters are seen or felt by patient in patient's mouth. However, one pain medication given through a vein in the patient may or may not be effective and providers are often challenged with providing good pain control while waiting for the new donor cells to grow, which will then heal the mouth. This is a period of waiting that is 6-8 weeks.\n\nThe investigators know that methadone, a second pain medication, may decrease pain in a different way than morphine. This is because methadone works in a different way in the brain than morphine. By giving these pain medicines together, the hope of the study is to show decreased pain while waiting for new cells to grow.\n\nThe goal of this clinical trial is to hope to learn whether adding methadone (second pain medication) to the current pain medication which is morphine alone (all patients will receive this pain medication) will help reduce the pain experience of participant. Current treatment of morphine alone is sometimes not entirely effective and so any improvement of pain while waiting for new cells to grow is one of the goals of this study. If methadone is effective in decreasing pain, then patients may benefit in the future from using these two medications up front when getting a transplant.\n\nParticipant in this study between 6-18 years of age and is needing a stem cell transplant for a disease that can potentially be cured by transplantation.\n\nParticipant in this study is receiving chemotherapy and/or radiation conditioning that can cause mucositis. Participants are being asked to participate in this study because participants meet criteria to receive methadone that may or may not reduce pain experience versus just being given morphine alone, which is what all patients are given when the participants have mucositis.\n\nThe main goal of the study is to see if less opioid (pain medication) when methadone is added in comparison to participant who uses PCA only. The investigators also want to learn if patient's overall function is improved if given methadone. Another goal would be to see the number of TPN days the participant received and if the participant who was given methadone began to eat sooner. Other smaller goals include learning about side effects of methadone, and if the hospital stay is less for those who receive the study medication.\n\nThis medication will be given at Children's Medical Center of Dallas while participant is admitted for the stem cell transplant.

The chemotherapy will kill cancer cells, but good cells, such as those in the mouth, are killed too. The mouth cells going away causes the areas in the mouth to be blistered, irritated, sore, and extremely painful. Pain medication (usually morphine or hydromorphone if allergic to morphine) are given when oral blisters are seen or felt by patient in patient's mouth. However, one pain medication given through a vein in the patient may or may not be effective and providers are often challenged with providing good pain control while waiting for the new donor cells to grow, which will then heal the mouth. This is a period of waiting that is 6-8 weeks.\n\nThe investigators know that methadone, a second pain medication, may decrease pain in a different way than morphine. This is because methadone works in a different way in the brain than morphine. By giving these pain medicines together, the hope of the study is to show decreased pain while waiting for new cells to grow.\n\nThe goal of this clinical trial is to hope to learn whether adding methadone (second pain medication) to the current pain medication which is morphine alone (all patients will receive this pain medication) will help reduce the pain experience of participant. Current treatment of morphine alone is sometimes not entirely effective and so any improvement of pain while waiting for new cells to grow is one of the goals of this study. If methadone is effective in decreasing pain, then patients may benefit in the future from using these two medications up front when getting a transplant.\n\nParticipant in this study between 6-18 years of age and is needing a stem cell transplant for a disease that can potentially be cured by transplantation.\n\nParticipant in this study is receiving chemotherapy and/or radiation conditioning that can cause mucositis. Participants are being asked to participate in this study because participants meet criteria to receive methadone that may or may not reduce pain experience versus just being given morphine alone, which is what all patients are given when the participants have mucositis.\n\nThe main goal of the study is to see if less opioid (pain medication) when methadone is added in comparison to participant who uses PCA only. The investigators also want to learn if patient's overall function is improved if given methadone. Another goal would be to see the number of TPN days the participant received and if the participant who was given methadone began to eat sooner. Other smaller goals include learning about side effects of methadone, and if the hospital stay is less for those who receive the study medication.\n\nThis medication will be given at Children's Medical Center of Dallas while participant is admitted for the stem cell transplant.

Corticosteroids are a class of medications, not a specific product by Sarepta Therapeutics. Sarepta is a biopharmaceutical company that develops treatments for rare diseases, particularly neuromuscular disorders like Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).\n\nLooking at the search results, I don't see any specific mention of Sarepta developing or marketing corticosteroids as a standalone product. Instead, the search results are primarily about:\n1. Sarepta's gene therapy called Elevidys (delandistrogene moxeparvovec-rokl) for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)\n2. Clinical holds on Sarepta's limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) trials\n3. Safety concerns related to liver injury, liver failure, and other adverse events\n\nFrom result [5], I see that corticosteroids are mentioned as part of the treatment protocol for Elevidys:\n\"Systemic corticosteroid treatment is recommended for patients before and after ELEVIDYS infusion.\"\n\nThis suggests that corticosteroids are used as part of the management protocol for patients receiving Elevidys, but they are not the product being developed or marketed by Sarepta. Corticosteroids are commonly used medications that would be prescribed alongside gene therapy to manage potential immune responses.\n\nThe search results indicate:\n- FDA placed clinical holds on Sarepta's LGMD trials (results [2], [3])\n- FDA requested Sarepta to suspend distribution of Elevidys (results [1], [3])\n- There were safety concerns including acute liver injury, acute liver failure, immune-mediated myositis, and myocarditis (results [1], [5])\n- The FDA asked Sarepta to narrow Elevidys' indication to only ambulatory patients (results [1], [3])\n- A black box warning was added regarding liver injury (results [1], [5])\n\nHowever, none of the search results mention FDA warning letters or clinical holds specifically for \"Corticosteroid\" by Sarepta Therapeutics.", "citations": []}, "sec_filings": {"found": true, "search_query": "SEC EDGAR 8-K filings by Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. mentioning clinical trial NCT06952686 or related drug safety issues.

This is a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating denifanstat, which appears to be a fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitor, for the treatment of Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) with fibrosis stages F2/F3.\n\nFrom result [2], I learn that Sagimet Biosciences is the company developing denifanstat, and they've completed a Phase 2b trial (FASCINATE-2) with positive results. Denifanstat has Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for non-cirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (F2-F3).\n\nFrom result [3], I see that Sagimet designed the FASCINATE-3 study (NCT06594523) to include an 18-month enrollment period, which the CEO (Dave Happel) explained is because patients often drop out of trials when they require additional liver biopsies.\n\nFrom result [5], there's a mention that NCT06594523 is listed as \"Withdrawn\" Phase 3.

tumor has a programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) greater than or equal to 20 in the first line setting. OPSCC is a type of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) originating in the oropharyngeal region (tonsil, tongue base, soft palate, or uvula). The study will evaluate the long-term safety and the benefits on objective response rate, overall survival, and progression-free survival of HB-202/HB-201 alternating 2-vector therapy plus pembrolizumab compared with pembrolizumab-only therapy.\n\nPembrolizumab-only therapy or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy are currently the first-line therapies used to treat people with recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC (including HPV+ OPSCC). However, poor prognosis prevails despite pembrolizumab therapy with or without chemotherapy (including patients with PD-L1 CPS greater or equal to 20), where only a minority of patients respond.\n\nHB-202 and HB-201 are genetically engineered, replicating vectors based on the arenaviruses Pichinde virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, respectively.

In an early phase trial (H-200-001, NCT04180215), HB-202/HB-201 alternating 2-vector therapy with pembrolizumab has shown favorable safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity with an objective response rate higher than previously reported with pembrolizumab-only therapy in participants with HPV16+ OPSCC.\n\nHB-202/HB-201 alternating 2-vector therapy or matched placebo will be administered in treatment cycles.

It mentions warnings about serious infections, mortality, malignancy, MACE, and thrombosis. But it doesn't mention any warning letters or clinical holds specifically for Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n\nResult 2: This is an NDA document for baricitinib. It mentions that the original NDA received a Complete Response (CR) action on April 12, 2017, due to safety concerns including venous thrombosis. However, this is related to the manufacturer (Eli Lilly) and not Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n\nResult 3: This is about an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for baricitinib for COVID-19 treatment. It doesn't mention Vanderbilt University Medical Center or any warning letters/clinical holds.\n\nResult 4: Another NDA document that mentions a Complete Response Letter issued on April 12, 2017, due to safety concerns. Again, this is related to the manufacturer, not Vanderbilt.\n\nResult 5: A fact sheet about baricitinib EUA for healthcare providers. No mention of Vanderbilt or warning letters.\n\nResult 6: An article about FDA staff raising safety concerns over baricitinib. It mentions concerns about blood clots at higher doses, but doesn't mention Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n\nResult 7: News about FDA broadening emergency use of baricitinib. No mention of Vanderbilt or warning letters.\n\nResult 8: A review of safety outcomes from clinical trials of baricitinib. It discusses safety concerns but doesn't mention Vanderbilt or specific warning letters.\n\nResult 9: A PDF about weekly COVID-19 clinical guidelines that mentions baricitinib has a black box warning for thrombotic events.

It includes exclusion criteria, study design (phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind), and participating sites. It mentions Vanderbilt University Medical Center as one of the sites. However, it doesn't contain any press releases, investor presentations, or public statements by Vanderbilt about safety issues, adverse events, trial termination, or regulatory actions.\n\n2. ClinicalTrials.gov listing for NCT05858515 - This provides basic information about the REVERSE-LC study, including that it's a phase 3 trial comparing baricitinib to placebo for Long COVID. It lists collaborators including Vanderbilt University. Again, no press releases or statements about safety issues.\n\n3. RechercheSanteQuebec.ca listing - Just shows basic information about the study with Vanderbilt as the promoter and the ClinicalTrials.gov reference. No safety information or press releases.\n\n4. PubMed article about baricitinib efficacy and safety - This is about a different trial (COV-BARRIER, NCT04421027) that studied baricitinib for acute COVID-19, not Long COVID. It does discuss safety findings from that trial (showing reduced mortality but similar rates of infections, blood clots, and adverse cardiovascular events between treatment groups). However, this is not about NCT05858515 and not a Vanderbilt press release.\n\n5. Gavin Publishers article - Describes case reports of two individuals with Long COVID who improved with baricitinib treatment. It mentions that baricitinib is being evaluated for Long COVID in trial NCT05858515, but doesn't provide any safety information specific to that trial or any Vanderbilt statements.\n\n6.

is open to adults with specific types of advanced soft tissue sarcoma.

This is a study for people whose earlier treatment isn't working anymore, and their doctors suggest a new treatment to stop the sarcoma from getting worse.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to compare a medicine called brigimadlin in combination with another medicine called ezabenlimab with chemotherapy. Brigimadlin is a so-called MDM2-p53 antagonist that is being developed to treat cancer. Ezabenlimab is an antibody that may help the immune system fight cancer.\n\nParticipants are put into 3 groups by chance:\n\n* Ezabenlimab group: Participants receive ezabenlimab as an infusion into a vein every 3 weeks\n* Brigimadlin + ezabenlimab group: Participants take brigimadlin as tablets and receive ezabenlimab as an infusion into a vein every 3 weeks\n* Chemotherapy group: Participants get chemotherapy as an infusion into a vein on 2 days every 3 weeks. Chemotherapy is a combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel which is often used in the treatment of sarcoma.\n\nThere are twice as many participants in the brigimadlin + ezabenlimab group and in the chemotherapy group, compared to those in the ezabenlimab group.\n\nParticipants can continue treatment in the study as long as they benefit from it and can tolerate it.\n\nDoctors regularly check the size of the tumor and check whether it has spread to other parts of the body. The doctors also regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects. Participants in this study use an app on a mobile phone to regularly answer questions about their health and well-being.

Include specific dates, reasons, and safety issues cited.", "summary": "<think>\nLet me analyze the search results to identify any FDA warning letters or clinical holds specifically related to Brigimadlin by Boehringer Ingelheim.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Brigimadlin is:\n- From results [6], [9], and others, Brigimadlin (BI 907828) is an oral MDM2-p53 antagonist being developed by Boehringer Ingelheim for cancer treatment, particularly for liposarcoma.\n- Results [3], [5], and [8] indicate that Boehringer Ingelheim discontinued development of Brigimadlin in early 2025 after a phase III trial failed to meet its primary endpoint.\n\nNow, let me look for specific FDA warning letters or clinical holds related to Brigimadlin:\n\n1. Results [1] and [2] discuss an FDA warning letter to Boehringer Ingelheim, but this appears to be from 2013 (issued May 6, 2013) related to cGMP violations at a manufacturing plant. The issues were about foreign particles in APIs and stability testing issues with Spiriva HandiHaler. This is not related to Brigimadlin.\n\n2. Result [3] mentions that Boehringer Ingelheim discontinued development of Brigimadlin after consulting with regulatory authorities (FDA), but this was due to the phase III trial not meeting its primary endpoint, not because of a warning letter or clinical hold.\n\n3. Result [4] discusses various FDA safety warnings for cancer drugs, but none specifically mention Brigimadlin.\n\n4. Results [6] and [9] describe the safety profile of Brigimadlin from phase I trials, noting common adverse events like nausea (74.1%), vomiting (51.9%), thrombocytopenia (25.9%), and neutropenia (24.1%). However, these are standard clinical trial findings, not FDA warning letters.\n\n5. Result [7] discusses a warning letter to Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health USA regarding their veterinary drug Senvelgo, issued March 1, 2024, and a follow-up on September 25, 2024. This is for an animal health product, not Brigimadlin.\n\n6.

It mentions something about diabetic eye care but doesn't contain any SEC filings information.\n\nResult [2]: This appears to be a SEC EDGAR search page showing company information. It shows fields for CIK, EIN, etc., but indicates \"No Filings for this company\" and \"No 8-K filing data for this company\". This suggests that either Boehringer Ingelheim doesn't file with the SEC (which makes sense as it's a German company) or the search wasn't specific enough.\n\nResult [3]: This is a link to an 8-K filing on SEC.gov, but the content shown doesn't specify which company it's for. It just shows the standard header for an 8-K form.\n\nResult [4]: This is from AnnualReports.com about Boehringer Ingelheim, but it doesn't mention any SEC filings or clinical trials.\n\nResult [5] and [6]: These are download centers for Boehringer Ingelheim's annual reports for 2022 and 2023 respectively. They don't appear to contain SEC filings information.\n\nKey observations:\n1. Boehringer Ingelheim is a German company (based on the domain and content)\n2. Foreign private issuers may have different filing requirements with the SEC\n3. None of the search results specifically mention clinical trial NCT06370871\n4. None of the search results provide CIK number for Boehringer Ingelheim\n5. Result [2] suggests there are no SEC filings for the company being searched\n\nI need to determine if Boehringer Ingelheim, as a German company, would file with the SEC. Many non-US companies don't file with the SEC unless they have securities listed on US exchanges. Boehringer Ingelheim is a private company (not publicly traded), which explains why there are no SEC filings.\n\n", "citations": [], "search_params": {"company": "Boehringer Ingelheim", "nct_id": "NCT06370871", "start_date": "2024-06-27"}}, "company_disclosures": {"found": true, "search_query": "Company press releases, investor presentations, or public statements by Boehringer Ingelheim about clinical trial NCT06370871 for Brigimadlin.

It states that \"Ezabenlimab was well tolerated and associated with durable antitumour activity in multiple solid tumours, comparable to other immune checkpoint inhibitors.\" This is general safety information about ezabenlimab but not specific to NCT06370871.\n\nResult [5] is just a general description of ezabenlimab as a PD-1 antibody", "citations": [], "search_params": {"company": "Boehringer Ingelheim", "nct_id": "NCT06370871", "drug_name": "Ezabenlimab"}}}}, "llm_analysis": {"classification": "FAILURE_ADMINISTRATIVE", "confidence": "high", "reasoning": "The official reason for the trial termination is \"Sponsor decision,\" indicating that the trial was withdrawn due to administrative or strategic reasons rather than safety or efficacy concerns.

advanced soft tissue sarcoma. People with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) or myxofibrosarcoma (MFS) can join the study if they have a normal version of the TP53 gene. This is a study for people whose earlier treatment isn't working anymore, and their doctors suggest a new treatment to stop the sarcoma from getting worse.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to compare a medicine called brigimadlin in combination with another medicine called ezabenlimab with chemotherapy. Brigimadlin is a so-called MDM2-p53 antagonist that is being developed to treat cancer. Ezabenlimab is an antibody that may help the immune system fight cancer.\n\nParticipants are put into 3 groups by chance:\n\n* Ezabenlimab group: Participants receive ezabenlimab as an infusion into a vein every 3 weeks\n* Brigimadlin + ezabenlimab group: Participants take brigimadlin as tablets and receive ezabenlimab as an infusion into a vein every 3 weeks\n* Chemotherapy group: Participants get chemotherapy as an infusion into a vein on 2 days every 3 weeks. Chemotherapy is a combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel which is often used in the treatment of sarcoma.\n\nThere are twice as many participants in the brigimadlin + ezabenlimab group and in the chemotherapy group, compared to those in the ezabenlimab group.\n\nParticipants can continue treatment in the study as long as they benefit from it and can tolerate it.\n\nDoctors regularly check the size of the tumor and check whether it has spread to other parts of the body.

Celgene is known for developing drugs like thalidomide (Thalomid) and lenalidomide (Revlimid), which are often used in combination with dexamethasone for treating multiple myeloma.\n\nLet me go through the search results to see if there's any specific information about FDA warning letters or clinical holds related to dexamethasone in the context of Celgene's products:\n\nResult 1: This discusses Celgene's unlawful marketing of Thalomid (thalidomide), including issues with off-label marketing and safety concerns like venous thromboembolism. It mentions that Thalomid was approved for multiple myeloma in combination with dexamethasone, but doesn't discuss any warning letters specifically for dexamethasone.\n\nResult 2: This is about recent FDA cancer drug safety warnings, but doesn't mention Celgene or dexamethasone specifically.\n\nResult 3: This discusses FDA reviewers identifying venous thromboembolism (VTE) safety concerns with thalidomide as a cancer treatment, particularly when used with dexamethasone. It mentions that FDA reviewers recommended that Celgene revise black-box warnings regarding these concerns, but doesn't mention a specific warning letter for dexamethasone.\n\nResult 4: This is about Dexcom (a medical device company) receiving a warning letter, not related to Celgene or dexamethasone.\n\nResult 5: This is a statement from Celgene Corporation discussing their risk management strategies for thalidomide, including the S.T.E.P.S. program. It mentions that Thalomid is used with dexamethasone for multiple myeloma, but doesn't discuss warning letters for dexamethasone.\n\nResult 6: This is about clinical holds for cell and gene therapy trials, not related to dexamethasone.\n\nResult 7: This is about FDA approval of lenalidomide (Revlimid) as maintenance therapy for multiple myeloma, but doesn't mention warning letters for dexamethasone.\n\nResult 8", "citations": []}, "sec_filings": {"found": true, "search_query": "SEC EDGAR 8-K filings by Celgene mentioning clinical trial NCT06232707 or related drug safety issues.

However, Juno was using it as part of their preconditioning regimen for their CAR-T cell therapies.\n\nFrom the search results, I can see several mentions of clinical holds related to Juno's CAR-T trials, particularly the ROCKET trial with JCAR015. Let me extract the relevant information:\n\n1. From result [1], [3], [5], [7], and [15], there was a clinical hold placed by the FDA on Juno's ROCKET trial (testing JCAR015) in July 2016 after three patient deaths due to cerebral edema. \n\n2. The key information about the clinical hold:\n   - Date: July 7, 2016 (mentioned in [1] and [5])\n   - Reason: Three patient deaths due to cerebral edema\n   - All patients were under 25 years old\n   - All patients were on a preconditioning regimen that included fludarabine and cyclophosphamide\n   - Juno suspected that the fludarabine in the preconditioning regimen was the problem\n   - Juno proposed to continue the trial using cyclophosphamide preconditioning only (without fludarabine)\n   - The FDA later lifted the clinical hold after reviewing Juno's proposal\n\n3. From result [5], we learn that the FDA requested Juno to submit:\n   - A revised patient informed-consent form\n   - A revised investigator brochure\n   - A revised trial protocol\n   - A copy of the presentation made to the agency\n\n4. From result [7], we learn that \"In early July 2016, the FDA asked Juno to halt the phase 2 trials of JCAR015 in patients with ALL, citing 3 deaths from cerebral edema. At that point, the company thought that fludarabine in the preconditioning regimen might be the culprit, and in a response to the FDA, Juno proposed leaving the drug out. Convinced by this response, the FDA allowed the HCAR015 trial to resume", "citations": []}, "sec_filings": {"found": true, "search_query": "SEC EDGAR 8-K filings by Juno Therapeutics, Inc., a Bristol-Myers Squibb Company mentioning clinical trial NCT06205290 or related drug safety issues.

From result [3]:\n- FDA asked Juno Therapeutics to halt the phase 2 clinical trial of JCAR015 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia\n- The culprit may be fludarabine recently introduced in the preconditioning regimen\n- Juno proposed to continue the trial with JCAR015 using cyclophosphamide alone for preconditioning\n\n3.

I need to include filing dates, CIK number, and specific material events disclosed\n\nLet me go through each search result:\n\nResult [1]: This is about Juno Therapeutics filing an 8-K regarding completion of acquisition or disposition of assets. It mentions that on March 5, 2018, Purchaser irrevocably accepted for payment all Shares validly tendered, and on March 6, 2018, the Merger was completed. Juno became a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene. It also mentions that Juno notified Nasdaq of the consummation of the Merger and requested delisting. There's a brief mention of \"CAR and TCR technologies\" which relates to their therapeutic approach, but no specific mention of clinical trial NCT06205290 or drug safety issues.\n\nResult [2]: This is a press release about Celgene Corporation acquiring Juno Therapeutics. It mentions the terms of the agreement (Celgene will acquire all outstanding shares for $87 per share in cash, or approximately $9 billion). It mentions that the acquisition is expected to be dilutive to adjusted EPS in 2018 by approximately $0.50. There's no specific mention of clinical trial NCT06205290 or drug safety issues.\n\nResult [3]: This appears to be a list of SEC EDGAR filings for Juno Therapeutics, Inc. It shows an S-8 POS filing and an 8-K filing both dated March 6, 2018. But it doesn't provide the content of these filings, just their existence.\n\nResult [4]: This seems to be a financial statement showing Juno's total assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2017.

From result [1], I see that Juno Therapeutics (NASDAQ:JUNO) completed a merger on March 6, 2018, becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene. This was done under Section 251(h) of the DGCL (Delaware General Corporation Law). The filing is an 8-K form dated March 6, 2018.\n\n2. From result [2], I see that Celgene Corporation announced a definitive merger agreement to acquire Juno Therapeutics on January 22, 2018. The acquisition was for $87 per share in cash, or approximately $9 billion. The transaction was expected to close in Q1 2018.\n\n3.

However, there's no specific mention of clinical trial NCT06205290 or drug safety issues related to a specific clinical trial.\n\nResult [2]: This is a press release about the merger agreement between Celgene and Juno dated January 22, 2018.

Pembrolizumab is a checkpoint inhibitor that may be able to stop this inhibition, allowing the immune system to attack the lymphoma.", "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the 2-year event free survival (EFS) of patients treated with pembrolizumab added to chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone, in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL) who are intended to receive salvage therapy followed by high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (HDT-ASCT).\n\nPRIMARY IMAGING OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the diagnostic performance of baseline total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) in predicting response (complete remission \\[CR\\] + partial remission \\[PR\\] versus \\[vs\\] no response) at pre-transplant/post-salvage for each arm separately and overall.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the 2-year progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the transplanted population.\n\nII. To assess the complete remission (CR) rate to salvage therapy. III. To assess the CR rate post HDT-ASCT. IV. To assess the post HDT-ASCT partial remission (PR) to CR conversion rate.\n\nSECONDARY IMAGING OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the % change in TMTV (delta TMTV) from baseline to pre-transplant/post-salvage in predicting response (CR+PR vs no response) at pre-transplant/post-salvage for each arm separately and overall.\n\nII. To assess baseline TMTV and delta TMTV in predicting EFS/OS for each arm separately and overall.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM A:\n\nSALVAGE THERAPY: Patients receive 1 of 3 chemotherapy regimens as clinically indicated: 1) ifosfamide intravenously (IV), carboplatin IV, and etoposide IV; 2) gemcitabine IV, vinorelbine IV, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin IV; or 3) brentuximab vedotin IV and bendamustine IV.

To assess the diagnostic performance of baseline total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) in predicting response (complete remission \\[CR\\] + partial remission \\[PR\\] versus \\[vs\\] no response) at pre-transplant/post-salvage for each arm separately and overall.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the 2-year progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the transplanted population.\n\nII. To assess the complete remission (CR) rate to salvage therapy. III. To assess the CR rate post HDT-ASCT. IV. To assess the post HDT-ASCT partial remission (PR) to CR conversion rate.\n\nSECONDARY IMAGING OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the % change in TMTV (delta TMTV) from baseline to pre-transplant/post-salvage in predicting response (CR+PR vs no response) at pre-transplant/post-salvage for each arm separately and overall.\n\nII. To assess baseline TMTV and delta TMTV in predicting EFS/OS for each arm separately and overall.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM A:\n\nSALVAGE THERAPY: Patients receive 1 of 3 chemotherapy regimens as clinically indicated: 1) ifosfamide intravenously (IV), carboplatin IV, and etoposide IV; 2) gemcitabine IV, vinorelbine IV, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin IV; or 3) brentuximab vedotin IV and bendamustine IV. Patients then undergo a positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan. Patients who achieve a CR or PR proceed to HDT-ASCT. Patients who achieve stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) come off study treatment.\n\nHDT-ASCT: Patients undergo ASCT. Patients may also receive a standard preparative chemotherapy regimen as clinically indicated. Patients who achieve PR prior to ASCT may also undergo radiation therapy (RT) as clinically indicated. Patients who went into ASCT with PR also undergo a PET/CT scan 30 days post-transplant.\n\nMAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients may receive brentuximab vedotin IV as clinically indicated.\n\nARM B:\n\nSALVAGE THERAPY: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV plus 1 of 3 chemotherapy regimens specified in Arm A as clinically indicated.

It's unusual to have warning letters specifically about \"Placebo\" as a product, unless Novartis manufactured or marketed something called \"Placebo\" (which would be highly unusual).\n\nLet me go through the search results to see if there's any mention of FDA warning letters or clinical holds related to placebo in Novartis trials:\n\nResult 1: This is about a warning letter to Novartis regarding Exelon Capsules and Oral.

It mentions a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA regarding poziotinib, not Docetaxel.\n\nResult [4]: This is a PDF about Taxotere (docetaxel) for Injection Concentrate. It appears to be an FDA approval document for docetaxel, but it doesn't mention Spectrum Pharmaceuticals specifically. It discusses safety issues like neurosensory and neuromotor toxicity.\n\nResult [5]: This is about a disproportionality analysis of adverse events associated with pertuzumab, not Docetaxel.\n\nResult [6]: This is the full prescribing information for docetaxel injection. It lists various safety warnings including toxic deaths, hepatotoxicity, neutropenia, hypersensitivity reactions, and fluid retention.

Date of the CRL: November 25, 2022 (mentioned in result [3] and [4])\n2. Reason for the CRL: \n   - The FDA determined that poziotinib could not be approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations.\n   - The CRL indicated that additional data would need to be gathered, including data from a randomized controlled study, before receiving approval.\n   - This decision followed an ODAC (Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee) meeting where members voted 9 to 4 that the benefits of poziotinib did not outweigh its risks.\n\n3. Safety issues cited:\n   - High toxicity profile: Grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) included rash (48.9%), diarrhea (25.6%), and stomatitis (24.4%).\n   - High rate of dose reductions: 76.7% of patients required dose reduction.\n   - 13.3% of patients permanently discontinued poziotinib due to TRAEs.\n   - 85% of patients had grade 3 and 4 adverse events, including rash, diarrhea, and mucositis.\n   - 57% of patients experienced dose reductions (mentioned in result [7]).\n   - Poor tolerability at the proposed dosage (16 mg once daily).\n\n4.

It's for adults and seniors in the USA.\n\nResult [6]: This is just the SEC search filings page, not a specific filing.\n\nResult [7]: This is from clinicaltrials.gov for NCT03318939, which is a Phase 2 study of Poziotin", "citations": [], "search_params": {"company": "Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc", "nct_id": "NCT05378763", "start_date": "2022-05-12"}}, "company_disclosures": {"found": true, "search_query": "Company press releases, investor presentations, or public statements by Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc about clinical trial NCT05378763 for Poziotinib.

However, this phrasing is unusual because placebo itself isn't a product that would receive warning letters - it would be about how Incyte conducted trials involving placebos.\n\nLet me go through the search results to find relevant information:\n\nResult [1]: This is about Incyte receiving a letter regarding PREA (Pediatric Research Equity Act) non-compliance for OPZELURA.

However, adoption of orlistat in the clinical setting has been hampered by its significant side effects and poor accessibility due to high cost and poor insurance coverage. Two additional anti-obesity medications, liraglutide and combination phentermine-topiramate, are in the FDA approval pipeline for pediatric obesity, yet these are also unlikely to be widely prescribed by primary care pediatricians. Both of these medications are also expensive and are unlikely to be covered by many insurance plans.

Yet in spite of its popularity and routine use beyond 12 weeks, significant gaps exist in our knowledge regarding its safety and efficacy in children and adolescents, many of whom may have abnormal CV profiles at baseline. Indeed, pediatric data regarding phentermine use are sparse: only one retrospective clinical report (published by our group), demonstrated a 4% BMI reduction at 6 months with no significant increase in blood pressure.\n\nTo address these important gaps and generate evidence to directly inform clinical care, we propose this multi-site, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to examine the weight loss efficacy and CV safety of phentermine 15 mg daily plus LST vs. placebo plus LST among 200 adolescents ages \u226510 to \\<18 years with obesity.

It mentions capecitabine, duvelisib, denosumab-bnht, and ciltacabtagene autoleucel. However, it doesn't specifically mention NRG Oncology or quality-of-life assessment issues.\n\nResult 2: This appears to be a PDF of the NRG-HN005 protocol. It discusses quality of life studies in clinical trials (referencing \"Design and analysis of quality of life studies in clinical trials (2nd ed.)\" by Fairclough). It mentions measuring \"symptomatic adverse events (AEs) for tolerability of each treatment arm as measured by the PRO-CTCAE\" and comparing \"changes in patient-reported outcomes (HHIA-S, EORTC-QLQ30)\". It also discusses toxicity profiles and dysphagia as a side effect of radiotherapy. However, it doesn't mention any FDA warning letters or clinical holds related to quality-of-life assessment.\n\nResult 3: This discusses a patient-reported outcome analysis of an NRG Oncology trial (NRG-LU005) in limited-stage small cell lung cancer. It mentions quality of life (QOL) benefits with twice-daily versus once-daily radiation. It states: \"PRO compliance for this analysis exceeded 85% at baseline and stabilized at 60-68% through 21 months after completion of chemoradiation.\" It also mentions: \"Higher completion correlated with better baseline performance status and pulmonary function.\" However, it doesn't mention any FDA warning letters or clinical holds.\n\nResult 4: This is about the FDA's Oncology Regulatory Expertise and Early Guidance (OREEG). It mentions ICH S9 and ICH S6 guidelines related to nonclinical evaluation of anticancer pharmaceuticals and preclinical safety evaluation. It doesn't specifically mention NRG Oncology or quality-of-life assessment issues.\n\nResult 5: This discusses an analysis of warning letters issued by the FDA.

This gene carries instructions that cause the tumor cells to turn Toca FC, typically used to treat fungal infections, into a drug that may kill the tumor cells.

It mentions \"warning for cardiopulmonary arrest in patients receiving...\" but this seems to be referring to a warning related to cetuximab (an anti-EGFR therapy), not specifically about radiation therapy. It doesn't mention any FDA warning letters or clinical holds for NRG Oncology's radiation therapy protocols.\n\nResult 2: This is about NRG Oncology Trial NRG-HN004 which compared durvalumab with cetuximab for head and neck cancer. It mentions that the trial was \"permanently closed to accrual\" but this was due to the study design (it didn't meet its endpoints), not because of an FDA warning letter or clinical hold.\n\nResult 3: Another article about NRG-HN004, confirming it was closed because durvalumab didn't improve outcomes compared to cetuximab.

It discusses radiation therapy toxicities but doesn't mention any FDA warning letters or clinical holds.\n\nResult 5: This is a protocol for NRG-GI001, a study of focal radiation therapy for cholangiocarcinoma. It mentions radiation therapy details but no FDA warning letters or clinical holds.\n\nResult 6: Just an update on breast cancer clinical trials, no relevant information.\n\nResult 7: This appears to be a protocol document for RTOG0522.

To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma treated with Toca 511 at the time of tumor resection followed by Toca FC in combination with standard of care (SOC) treatment to patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma treated with SOC after tumor resection. (Phase II) II. To compare the overall survival (OS) from time of randomization of all patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma treated with Toca 511 at the time of tumor resection followed by Toca FC in combination with SOC treatment to patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma treated with SOC after tumor resection. (Phase III)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety of each arm as administered in this study. II. To compare the OS between arms (only for phase II part of the study). III. To compare the PFS between arms using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) (only for phase III part of the study).\n\nIV. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) in patients with measurable disease at the post-surgical scan.\n\nV. To evaluate the effect of IDH mutation status on survival outcomes between arms.\n\nVI. To evaluate the PFS and OS by extent of resection. VII. To evaluate the effect of MGMT methylation status on survival outcomes between arms.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the duration of response (DoR) in patients with measurable disease at the post-surgical scan using mRANO.\n\nII. To evaluate the effect of corticosteroids administration on efficacy of Toca 511 and Toca FC.\n\nIII. To optimize quality assurance methodologies and processes for radiotherapy and imaging.\n\nIV. To determine if there is a tumor-microenvironment signature based on ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing that is associated with a selective increase in benefit from the addition of Toca 511 and Toca FC.\n\nV. To compare regional genomic heterogeneity and molecular profiles, as measured by RNA sequencing and methylation analyses between arms.\n\nVI. To compare quality of life (QOL), as measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Brain Cancer Module (BN20), between arms.\n\nVII. To compare health utilities, as measured by the EuroQoL 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L), between arms.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Beginning on week 5 following standard of care surgery, patients undergo radiation therapy over 30 fractions 5 days per week for up to 6 weeks, and receive temozolomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) for up to 49 days. At the discretion of treating physician, patients may also receive novoTTF-100A (Optune) device 0-7 weeks following radiation and temozolomide treatment. One month following completion of radiation therapy, patients continue to receive temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II: Patients receive vocimagene amiretrorepvec via intracranial injection during surgery on day 1.

Demonstrate feasibility to ensure adequate patient enrollment and symptomatic follow-up of patients with Lyme arthritis.\n2. Develop pilot data necessary for sample size and power calculations:\n\nThe purpose of the research study is to evaluate whether there is symptomatic benefit of schedule NSAID therapy in patients with Lyme arthritis diagnosis.\n\n1. Quantification of antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis in our population\n2. Symptomatic outcomes of patients with Lyme arthritis on scheduled NSAIDs versus those not placed on scheduled NSAIDs (duration to resolution and number of patients with resistant arthritis)\n3. Assess side effects of patients with Lyme arthritis placed on scheduled NSAIDs versus those not placed on scheduled NSAIDs\n4. Assess changes in resources (follow-up visits, further prescriptions) required for patients taking scheduled NSAIDs versus not taking scheduled NSAIDs\n\nBackground:\n\nLyme disease is the systemic tick-borne disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi infection, and is endemic to an expanding portion of the United States. Lyme arthritis is a common presentation of Lyme disease. While Lyme arthritis resolves with appropriate antimicrobial treatment in a majority of patients, 10-20% of patients develop antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis with prolonged inflammatory arthritis. Research suggests excessive up-regulation of the inflammatory process in patients with prolonged symptoms. The over-expressed pro- inflammatory cell mediators are downstream of NSAID inhibition, which would suggest NSAIDs may be beneficial in these patients. In fact, there is data that NSAIDs and/or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may be beneficial in refractory Lyme arthritis cases, once diagnosed as refractory.\n\nThe hypothesis of the study is that prescribing scheduled NSAIDs at the time of diagnosis can prevent the development of the excessive inflammatory phase and decrease the number of patients with antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis, or at least decrease the duration of persistent Lyme arthritis symptoms. There are no known methods to identify patients who will develop antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis. This work is important to delineate optimal timing and duration of NSAIDs given the research that shows the anti- inflammatory effects during healing can potentially delay recovery.\n\nSignificance:\n\nWhile antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis has been studied at a microbiologic/cytokine level as well as evaluated in terms of treatment once patients have been deemed antibiotic refractory, to our knowledge there are no published studies evaluating prevention.\n\nWith no literature looking at the question of NSAIDs for the prevention of antibiotic- refractory Lyme arthritis, this pilot study is needed to adequately calculate sample size and power calculations for a large-scale multicenter study.

Symptomatic outcomes of patients with Lyme arthritis on scheduled NSAIDs versus those not placed on scheduled NSAIDs (duration to resolution and number of patients with resistant arthritis)\n3. Assess side effects of patients with Lyme arthritis placed on scheduled NSAIDs versus those not placed on scheduled NSAIDs\n4. Assess changes in resources (follow-up visits, further prescriptions) required for patients taking scheduled NSAIDs versus not taking scheduled NSAIDs\n\nBackground:\n\nLyme disease is the systemic tick-borne disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi infection, and is endemic to an expanding portion of the United States. Lyme arthritis is a common presentation of Lyme disease. While Lyme arthritis resolves with appropriate antimicrobial treatment in a majority of patients, 10-20% of patients develop antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis with prolonged inflammatory arthritis. Research suggests excessive up-regulation of the inflammatory process in patients with prolonged symptoms. The over-expressed pro- inflammatory cell mediators are downstream of NSAID inhibition, which would suggest NSAIDs may be beneficial in these patients. In fact, there is data that NSAIDs and/or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may be beneficial in refractory Lyme arthritis cases, once diagnosed as refractory.\n\nThe hypothesis of the study is that prescribing scheduled NSAIDs at the time of diagnosis can prevent the development of the excessive inflammatory phase and decrease the number of patients with antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis, or at least decrease the duration of persistent Lyme arthritis symptoms. There are no known methods to identify patients who will develop antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis. This work is important to delineate optimal timing and duration of NSAIDs given the research that shows the anti- inflammatory effects during healing can potentially delay recovery.\n\nSignificance:\n\nWhile antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis has been studied at a microbiologic/cytokine level as well as evaluated in terms of treatment once patients have been deemed antibiotic refractory, to our knowledge there are no published studies evaluating prevention.\n\nWith no literature looking at the question of NSAIDs for the prevention of antibiotic- refractory Lyme arthritis, this pilot study is needed to adequately calculate sample size and power calculations for a large-scale multicenter study. There is anecdotal data from the Rheumatology and Infectious Disease departments at the UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh that early scheduled NSAIDs may decrease refractory cases, but there has been no formal evaluation into this question.

Prostate cancer represents 30% of all cancer diagnoses in men. Despite earlier detection and new treatments the life time risk to die of prostate cancer has remained stable at 3% since 1980.\n\nIn metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (with progression on antihormonal therapy) the primary standard therapy for a long time consisted of chemotherapy with docetaxel. It was recently shown that treatment with the novel androgen synthesis blocker, abiraterone (Zytiga) before chemotherapy can prolong survival. Abiraterone belongs to a group of agents that very effectively inhibits the androgen synthesis via blockade of the key enzyme cytochrome P-450c17 (CYP17).Similar results have been reported for the new androgen antagonist enzalutamide (Xtandi). Today, therefore, many patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) first receive therapy with abiraterone or enzalutamide. After this, chemotherapy with docetaxel (Taxotere) or cabazitaxel (Jevtana) is usually administered if there is any further progression of the disease. After the end of chemotherapy, the patient is regularly checked and, in the event of disease progression, further treatments may be given. These could consist of renewed hormonal therapy or chemotherapy with cabazitaxel. Besides abiraterone, the medicine orteronel also acts by blocking testosterone production via the key enzyme CYP17. By selectively inhibiting the extragonadal synthesis of androgens in either the adrenal cortex or in prostate tumor cells, orteronel, a selective non-steroidal CYP17 inhibitor, may represent a new therapeutic option for patients with CRPC. Initial results have shown that orteronel effectively inhibits testosterone synthesis.\n\nHypothesis and aim of the study\n\nSince various new options are available for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer at present, this raises the question as to the order in which these treatments should best be given.

There is evidence to suggest that any resistance to hormone treatments could be reversible as a result of prior treatment with chemotherapy. This study is designed to investigate this approach.

diagnosed with cancer of the prostate during his lifetime. Accordingly, prostate cancer is the most common cancer amongst men in the western world. In Switzerland approx. 5'400 men are diagnosed with the disease and 1'300 die of prostate cancer every year. Prostate cancer represents 30% of all cancer diagnoses in men. Despite earlier detection and new treatments the life time risk to die of prostate cancer has remained stable at 3% since 1980.\n\nIn metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (with progression on antihormonal therapy) the primary standard therapy for a long time consisted of chemotherapy with docetaxel. It was recently shown that treatment with the novel androgen synthesis blocker, abiraterone (Zytiga) before chemotherapy can prolong survival. Abiraterone belongs to a group of agents that very effectively inhibits the androgen synthesis via blockade of the key enzyme cytochrome P-450c17 (CYP17).Similar results have been reported for the new androgen antagonist enzalutamide (Xtandi). Today, therefore, many patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) first receive therapy with abiraterone or enzalutamide. After this, chemotherapy with docetaxel (Taxotere) or cabazitaxel (Jevtana) is usually administered if there is any further progression of the disease. After the end of chemotherapy, the patient is regularly checked and, in the event of disease progression, further treatments may be given. These could consist of renewed hormonal therapy or chemotherapy with cabazitaxel. Besides abiraterone, the medicine orteronel also acts by blocking testosterone production via the key enzyme CYP17. By selectively inhibiting the extragonadal synthesis of androgens in either the adrenal cortex or in prostate tumor cells, orteronel, a selective non-steroidal CYP17 inhibitor, may represent a new therapeutic option for patients with CRPC. Initial results have shown that orteronel effectively inhibits testosterone synthesis.\n\nHypothesis and aim of the study\n\nSince various new options are available for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer at present, this raises the question as to the order in which these treatments should best be given. Initial results show that cross-resistance could develop between the new kinds of hormone therapy abiraterone and enzalutamide. There is evidence to suggest that any resistance to hormone treatments could be reversible as a result of prior treatment with chemotherapy. This study is designed to investigate this approach. It is also intended to investigate whether early use of the well-tolerated testosterone synthesis blocker orteronel in patients with mCRPC leads to an increase in the time to the progression of disease. Trials examining other advanced malignant diseases such as lung cancer have shown that initiating an effective treatment earlier in the disease course at the end of a first-line chemotherapy (so called switch maintenance therapy) is beneficial in terms of progression free survival (PFS) but also overall survival (OS). This may also hold true for early administration of antihormonal agents in patients with mCRPC.\n\nPatients who have already received a novel hormonal therapy followed by chemotherapy with a taxane and have experienced a stabilization of disease on this regimen are included in the study. It is also intended to test whether this treatment has a positive influence on the quality of life of patients.\n\nThe aim of this trial is to test the hypothesis that using orteronel treatment immediately after cessation of chemotherapy with a taxane can prolong event-free survival (EFS), consequently maintains a good quality of life (QL) and could eventually also improve overall survival for the group of patients pretreated with novel hormonal agents.", "aact_documents": [], "pubmed_results": [{"pmid": "41236500", "title": "Colchicine and cardiovascular events: An updated meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials.", "authors": [{"name": "Xie S", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Galimberti F", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Olmastroni E", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}]}, {"pmid": "41236362", "title": "Feasibility and tolerability of low-dose lithium for the treatment of agitation and abnormal motor behaviors in Frontotemporal Dementia.", "authors": [{"name": "Zide BS", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Barker MS", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Silverman HE", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}]}, {"pmid": "41235517", "title": "[The effect of AntiAGE-Biom probiotic on metabolic features in individuals with type 2 diabetes].", "authors": [{"name": "Shestakova EA", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Nosova AV", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Dzgoeva FK", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}]}, {"pmid": "41235391", "title": "Astragalus membranaceus extract reduces functional knee joint pain: a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial.", "authors": [{"name": "Lippi L", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Turco A", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Rudrappa GH", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}]}, {"pmid": "41235106", "title": "Atorvastatin as an immunomodulatory adjunct in ulcerative colitis, beyond lipid lowering to inflammation control: a randomized controlled pilot study.", "authors": [{"name": "Khrieba MO", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Abdulelah FM", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}, {"name": "Alsaleh NA", "authtype": "Author", "clusterid": ""}]}], "clinicaltrials_api": {"has_results": false, "brief_summary": "The main object of this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial is to assess impact of maintenance of orteronel on disease progression and hence on quality of life of patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer pretreated with novel hormonal agents who have non-progressive disease after chemotherapy with a taxane.", "detailed_description": "Background\n\nOne in six men will be diagnosed with cancer of the prostate during his lifetime.
